On paper. Yes. Studies show that using pen and paper trump taking notes on a device. The main reason is because you cannot possibly write down everything I am saying by hand. This forces you to selectively filter my lecture to its most essential and important components \u0026ndash; an integral part of the learning and retention process. If you are taking notes on a laptop, you become a court stenographer, thoughtlessly transcribing everything I am saying. At the other extreme, do not assume everything is written in my lecture slides. My lecture slides are visuals and cues to organize the content both for me and for you. I try hard to make sure that I have few words on slides, and even fewer answers to problems.  My suggestion: print out my lecture slides in advance (or follow along on your device) and take additional notes by hand.   At least skim all of the readings. I give out readings for a reason, and that reason is not to bore you or waste your time. The truth is, as a beginner, you can\u0026rsquo;t rely on heuristics or memory to \u0026ldquo;fill in the blanks.\u0026rdquo; You need the readings to provide context to what I am saying in class. I cannot help you if you are not going to try. Any professor also will lose patience at short notice when it\u0026rsquo;s discovered you haven\u0026rsquo;t done the reading. Do the homeworks (if there are any). You might be surprised that I need to say this, but I do. Students that do not do the homeworks do poorly on exams, which often are similar to homework questions. Homeworks are the best practice for exams, they give you a sense of the relevant content areas that might come up, the type and style of questions that I ask, and you often get answer keys to help you \u0026ldquo;get inside my head\u0026rdquo; and study from. There is no good reason why you should have a low homework grade. Work on assignments together and study together. Recognize that you are not in this alone, and other students are just as anxious or uncertain as you are. More surprisingly, other students probably have some answers you are looking for, and you may have answers for some of their problems! You will learn better when you collaborate with others similar to you. More importantly, you don\u0026rsquo;t truly understand something unless you can explain it to others.^[Yes, that means I am doing a ton of learning every time I teach!] As a wise woman once told me \u0026ldquo;whomever is doing the talking is doing the learning.\u0026rdquo; Learn how to learn. The most important skill you learn in college is how to learn. Taking a course on a subject will not make you an expert on that subject. It a) helps you recognize that you do not know everything on that subject, and this prevents you from actively saying stupid things; and b) gives you enough context and skills to figure out how to actually fill those gaps. This is the actual skill that\u0026rsquo;s relevant in the real world.^[Yes, Google is your best friend.

Please try to frame your photos properly! Put your paper flat on a solid surface (table, desk, the floor, etc). Get the whole page within the borders of the photo, and not too much background. I don\u0026rsquo;t need to see half of your desk or bed as you are taking the photo! Take a look at it and make sure it is legible.\nNext, get the photos onto your computer (whether by Airdrop, email to yourself, Dropbox, etc.). Finally, depending on your OS, convert the files to a PDF:\n1. On a Windows PC\nOpen the folder where your photos are currently, in the File Explorer. Select all of the photos, and right click, and select Print. In the dialog box that pops up, select Microsoft Print to PDF in the Printer box, and then click Print. This will save it as a .pdf file in that folder. See more information.\n2. On a Mac\nAs I use a Mac, I will show you how Mac OS has a neat feature built into Finder, which allows converting multiple files into a single PDF file as a Quick Action.

M. Forster\n  How to Write a Good Paper    How to Write a Good Paper (Slides)   See examples of good Op-eds from previous students on Blackboard (Under Course Documents)\n  Overview Your task is to write an Opinion-Editorial (Op-ed) piece that applies the economic way of thinking to some public policy-relevant issue. An op-ed is a newspaper article that expresses the opinions of a writer who is unaffiliated with the newspaper or its editorial board. Often, the writer of an op-ed has no journalism experience, or (as you will soon discover), little understanding of economics. Thus, you are at no disadvantage as a student just beginning your experience with economics and writing! To get an idea, look at any newspaper’s “Opinion” section on their website or in print.\nThe purpose of this assignment is fourfold: (1) to demonstrate to you that economics is a wonderful way of thinking about any social issue, (2) for you to demonstrate to me that you have mastered the material of this course, (3) to develop your writing and argumentative skills, and (4) to help you develop, change, and/or strengthen your own views by grappling with them in writing.\nIn general, am looking for a short paper that puts forth an argument and defends it. You should be able to summarize your position in one sentence – the thesis of your paper that you will argue for. It should be a reasonably original argument (it is difficult with limited knowledge to offer something truly original), and it should be your own take on the topic. It should use some principle(s) or insight(s) from (micro) economics to bolster your conclusions.\nPlease note that, while you are not required to, I highly recommend discussing your ideas with me over email or in person. I will also read any drafts you would like to submit to me early, and provide you with helpful comments, subject to my own availability. Both to disincentivize procrastination, and because I have no time to read 100 papers right before the end of class, I will stop reading and commenting on drafts after May 7\nIf you publish your op-ed in any media outlet (newspapers, news websites, major blogs) by the end of the semester, you will earn extra credit according to the following scale:1\n  Publication Examples Points    Hood-affiliated outlet The Blue and Grey, Professors’ blogs 10  Local/regional Newspaper Frederick News-Post 20  National Newspaper/blog NY Times, WaPo, WSJ, USA Today, HuffPo 40    Meeting the market test is what matters most!\nYour Op-Ed, with a word count, is due by 11:59 PM Friday May 14, via Chalk-and-Wire upload, and constitutes 20% of your final course grade.\n Length, References, \u0026amp; Mechanics The goal of any op-ed is to convince reasonably-educated readers of some particular conclusion (also known as a thesis). This conclusion is of course, the opinion of the author, but this opinion must be backed by theory and evidence that leads reasonable people to agree with that conclusion. The claim you make as your conclusion should be relevant, debatable, testable, and provide new insight on a topic. Telling the reader “people who do not recycle are selfish” is neither informative nor persuasive, but telling the reader “recycling reduces the amount of trash going into local landfills by X tons a year” is at least informative, if not also persuasive. You are free to take any position on any issue that you choose, so long as it is backed by evidence and sound use of the economic way of thinking. For more details, see my presentation slides linked above.\nI always hesitate to give formal length requirements, because most students will write the bare minimum, and also because different papers have different optimal lengths. What truly matters is that your paper is long enough to say what you need to say, to say it well, and to say it briefly. Ceterus paribus, if papers A and B say the same thing, but paper B says it in half the length (without sacrificing key arguments), paper B is a better paper. In any event, this assignment will largely follow the style of most major newspapers. Your op-ed must be between 500 and 1000 words. You must include a word count with your final copy. There are no other formal requirements but, I recommend formatting it in 12 point Times New Roman or Arial font, double spaced, just to make it easier for me to read (and nearly every other paper you write will ask for this).\nWhile this is not a research paper, I do want you to include some scholarly sources – for example, if you cite the work of an economist on the issue, or if you use statistics, data, or facts (which you should!). While newspapers do not publish a bibliography for each op-ed, they will scrutinize every empirical claim and ask the author for sources to back it up. Thus, I would like a list of sources you used for your article, and expect you to have at least 1-3, depending on your topic and argument. I am not particularly picky about exactly how you format this list, just please be consistent. Look at my slides or my handouts for a suggested style.\n Suggested Topics Remember that economics is a way of analyzing the world, rather than a narrow domain of topics for studying. Thus, while you may certainly write about the typical “mundane” topics of economics we often think about (money, monopoly, inflation, etc), I strongly encourage you to apply economics to something you find much more interesting about the world - from corruption in FIFA, to the constitutional political economy of pirates, to bitcoin displacing currencies, to the illegal downloading of Game of Thrones, to the cultural institutions of the Jersey Shore, to the monopoly power of the WWE in wrestling, to the relationship of Uber \u0026amp; Airbnb to taxis and hotels, to the privatization of asteroids, to the economics of crowdfunding, to drugs, sex, and rock n roll. In fact, it is often those topics that are most eccentric and “out in left field” that make the best op-eds!\nThere are plenty of issues around us, both immediate and visible (racism and policing, college costs, ISIS, planned parenthood, gun control, etc) and latent long term issues (monetary policy and interest rates, the drug war, government spending and debt, science funding, etc).\nThe scope of topics allowed for your paper is anything that uses the economic way of thinking to make some sort of conclusion. This is an extremely wide scope, but here are a few main types of op-eds that will tend to result from this, along with some great examples of op-eds that use economics to reach an interesting or provocative conclusion.\nTaking a stand on a position, either actively being discussed in the news, or a long-standing underlying issue   The Case for Getting Rid of Borders - Completely (The Atlantic) The Racial Reality of Policing (Wall Street Journal) Zoning Out the Poor (Washington Post) This Child Doesn’t Need a Solar Panel (Wall Street Journal) How to Save Detroit (Wall Street Journal) In an Uber World, Fortune Favors the Freelancer (New York Times) What the West Gets Wrong About Russia (New York Times)  Criticizing recent statements, current popular fallacies, or policy proposals of others in the news   Shut Up Royal Baby Haters, Monarchy is Awesome (Washington Post) Trump’s Protectionist Fallacies Have Been Refuted By Free Market Economists for Hundreds of Years (Huffington Post) Trump’s Exploits Rational Ignorance (USA Today) Bernie Sanders on Immigrants: Silly, Tribal and Economically Illiterate (Newsweek) The Myth of a Stagnant Middle Class (Wall Street Journal) The ‘77 cents on the Dollar’ Myth About Women’s Pay (Wall Street Journal) How Everyone Gets the Sharing Economy Wrong (Wall Street Journal) Why Bill Gates Hates my Book (Wall Street Journal) In Zimbabwe, We Don’t Cry for Lions (New York Times)  Providing new insight into a social phenomenon that is interesting or novel, designed to get people talking   Driven to Kill: Why Drivers in China Intentionally Kill the Pedestrians they Hit (Slate) The Case for the City-State (Wall Street Journal) What Hollywood Can Teach Us About the Future of Work (New York Times) Losing is Good for You (New York Times) The $250 Econ 101 Textbook (Wall Street Journal) Cash for Kidneys: The Case for a Market for Organs (Wall Street Journal) The Bitcoin Schism Shows the Genius of Open Source (Wired) Should Physician Pay Be Tied to Performance? (Wall Street Journal)   Sources for Inspiration Here is a list of a few places you might consider to dig up some information on your topic, or to help you find a topic. Just be sure to read and cite the actual sources that these secondary sources cite.\n Major news outlets (e.g. CNN, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, USA Today, Huffington Post, the Guardian) and wherever you may find your news (e.g. reddit, Buzzfeed, etc) both for current events, and also their Opinion/Commentary sections for other op-eds to learn from and/or critique Wikipedia – no seriously, it is the first place I go to learn about a new topic. Just be sure to actually investigate the underlying research and use that for your references! Economics Podcasts  Econtalk – a fantastic podcast series by Russ Roberts that interviews famous economists, philosophers, businesspeople, and other figures who have an impact on the world of ideas Freakonomics (Radio) – another great podcast by one of the authors of the famed Freakonomics books about intermediate-level economic topics, often an in-depth series of interviews on a major issue NPR Planet Money – another good podcast series on economics topics and current events, much shorter and more 10,000-foot level approach than Econtalk or Freakonomics  Popular Economists’ Blogs/Blogs on Economics:  Marginal Revolution – Tyler Cowen \u0026amp; Alex Tabarrok (head and shoulders above the rest!) Cafe Hayek – Don Boudreaux (libertarian-leaning, mostly just Don on trade and micro-policy) EconLog – Bryan Caplan, David Henderson (libertarian-leaning, good analysis) The Conscience of a Liberal – Paul Krugman at New York Times (strong left-wing politics) The Grumpy Economist – John Cochrane (Chicago School approach) Greg Mankiw’s Blog – Greg Mankiw (moderate conservative, New Keynesian approach) Undercover Economist – Tim Harford (British, non-political, very easy to understand) Chris Blattman – Chris Blattman (great on economic development, poverty, and conflict in poor countries) Slate Star Codex – “Scott Alexander” (a pseudonym, apparently a Medical Student, but one of the most lucid social science blogs ever written) Fivethirtyeight – Nate Silver \u0026amp; co. (a journalist, but a leader on using data and statistics in social science and journalism) Andrew Gelman – Andrew Gelman (a statistician, but another leader on using data and statistics for social science)    Grading Rubric and Deadlines Here is the rubric that I will use to grade your paper:\n  Category Points    Persuasiveness 30  Soundness 30  Clarity 20  Organization 10  References 5  Style 5  TOTAL 100     Persuasiveness: How persuasive is your argument? Would a reasonably educated college-level reader who is familiar with economics and statistics but not necessarily this course find themselves understanding your argument and agreeing with you? [Write for an audience wider than just members of this class. Therefore, don’t use terms, sources, or “inside jokes” that only other students in this class (and no one else) would understand.] Remember, your goal is not to convince me (though you may), your goal is to convince any educated reader, and I grade you the probability that this is likely. You are the lawyer, I am the judge, and your audience is the jury. Soundness: Are your theories consistent and logical, and did you apply them correctly? Did you choose relevant (and non-cherry picked) evidence to back it up? Are your facts, data, or case studies accurate? Clarity How clear is your paper? Is it clear what your research question is, how you answer it, and what your results are? Can you summarize these in a sentence or two? Are there confusing passages, excessive jargon or passive voice, or irrelevant arguments and examples? Organization: Is your paper organized? Have you presented your separate arguments/examples in a logical order? Is it clear when you are moving on from one section to another? Is it clear when and where you are summarizing and concluding? References: Does your paper use multiple reputable references? Does it properly cite them in the text for main ideas borrowed and for direct quotations? Are they consistently listed at the end in a references section? Style: Is your paper interesting and easy to read? Does it engage the reader? Is it written in active voice? This is somewhat subjective, and hence, the smallest portion of your grade.    Note: Websites like reddit, Buzzfeed, or personal blogs that do not require professional editorial approval do not count!↩︎\n   ","date":1591574400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627240224,"objectID":"9c3115b8477764224b64eaf4850ac2f6","permalink":"https://microf21.classes.ryansafner.com/assignments/research-paper/","publishdate":"2020-06-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/assignments/research-paper/","section":"assignments","summary":"How to Write a Good Paper Overview Length, References, \u0026amp; Mechanics Suggested Topics Sources for Inspiration Grading Rubric and Deadlines    Due by DATE and TIME by CHALK-AND-WIRE UPLOAD (include a word count)    “How can I know what I think until I see what I say?” — E.

M. Forster\n  “No economist has achieved scientific success as a result of a statistically significant coefficient. Massed observations, clever common sense, elegant theorems, new policies, sagacious economic reasoning, historical perspective, relevant accounting, these have all led to scientific success. Statistical significance has not.” — McCloskey and Ziliak, “The Cult of Statistical Significance” (1996: 112)\n  Writing and Reading Empirical Papers Slides](/slides/paper-slides.html) - [ Example Paper Project](https://github.com/ryansafner/example_empirical_paper)-- Overview Your task is to write a research paper on any topic in political economy of your choosing so long as it has an empirical component. The purpose of this paper is threefold: (1) to demonstrate to me that you have mastered the material of this course, (2) to develop your writing, communication, and data analysis skills, and (3) to help you develop, strengthen, and/or modify your own views by grappling with them in writing. As a reminder, this paper constitutes 25% of your final course grade.\nI will spend a significant portion of one class discussing more about the writing process, and provide a detailed guide to help you choose a topic, craft arguments, and write a good paper.\nI am NOT looking for a survey of existing research, a series of block quotes showing what some economist said about X, a regurgitation of my lectures, a list of pros and cons with a last minute conclusion, a book review, and so on. I also do NOT want you to compress everything about econometrics you learned from this class into a single paper. You should only use those insights that are relevant to your topic and your argument (it may only be one or two things!).\nI am looking for a paper that attempts to answer a specific research question of interest to economists by using data analysis. You should be able to summarize your paper in one or two sentences – the specific research question your paper addresses, your method for answering it, and your results. It should be a reasonably original paper (it is difficult with limited knowledge, time, and data to offer something truly original), and it should be your own take on the topic. I expect you to, at the very least, have one multivariate regression used to reach your conclusions. I do not expect or require you to find statistically significant results.\nPlease note that, while you are not required to, I highly recommend discussing your ideas with me over email or in person. I will also read any drafts you would like to submit to me early, and provide you with helpful comments, subject to my own availability. I will stop accepting drafts to provide comments by November 30.\n Length, References, \u0026amp; Mechanics I hesitate to give formal length requirements, because most students will write the bare minimum, and also because different papers have different optimal lengths. What truly matters is that your paper is long enough to say what you need to say, to say it well, and to say it briefly. Ceterus paribus, if papers \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) say the same thing, but paper \\(B\\) says it in half the length (without sacrificing key arguments), paper \\(B\\) is a better paper. You will also find that simply by including the necessary components of an empirical paper (plots, tables, etc.), your page count will by necessity increase on its own.\nSince you of course still want to know what a good length will be, my rule of thumb is that your paper should be about \\(\\mathbf{10\\pm 5}\\) pages (size 12 font, double spaced, 1\" margins). This will depend on the topic you have chosen to written on, your data, and your own personal writing style.\nI would also like you to use scholarly references, that is, articles from economics journals and cite them properly. I do not have a minimum requirement of the amount of references, but I expect you to have at least 2-5 scholarly references, depending on your paper topic and thesis. I am not particularly picky about exactly how you format your citations or bibliography, just please be consistent, and do not use footnotes or endnotes (only because they annoy me). I suggest the APA author-year-page in-text citation format that is fairly standard in economics journals, i.e.: “The division of labor is limited by the extent of the market,” (Smith 1776: 27). Look at my slides or my handouts for a suggested bibliography style. If you use .bib files, the default formatting is fine.\n Sources for Inspiration Here is a list of a few places you might consider to dig up some information on your topic, or to help you find a topic. Just be sure to read and cite the actual sources that these secondary sources cite.\n Major news outlets (e.g. CNN, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, USA Today, Huffington Post, the Guardian) and wherever you may find your news (e.g. reddit, Buzzfeed, etc) both for current events, and also their Opinion/Commentary sections for other op-eds to learn from and/or critique Wikipedia – no seriously, it is the first place I go to learn about a new topic.

You will find out quickly that the constraint to writing an empirical paper is not the set of topics or questions to write on (though that is often a challenge itself!), but the data available to use.\nDepending on the topic, you can also collect your own data, and many times you will want to create a custom dataset by simply combining data from different sources.\nDon’t forget to check out the Data Resources for ideas and examples of how and where to find data sets.\n Grading Rubric and Deadlines While it may be possible for many papers in your college career, is not a paper you can write the last minute and do well on. To ensure that you do not get too far behind, I have split the assignment into stages that are due at different intervals over the semester. Note that your topic can and may change depending on what you are able to find and work with. The hardest part is finding data that allows you to test a research question. It is primarily for this reason that writing an empirical paper on what you want is very difficult.\n    Assignment Points Due Date Description    Abstract 5 Sun Oct 11 Short summary of your ideas  Literature Review 10 Sun Nov 1 1-3 paragraphs on 2-3 scholarly sources  Data Description 10 Sun Nov 15 Description of data sources, and some summary statistics  Presentation 5 Thurs Nov 19 Short presentation of your project so far  Final Paper Due 70 Tues Nov 22 Email to me paper, data, and code    All assignments are due by emails to me.\n Abstract: write a short paragraph (3-6 sentences) summarizing: what rough topic you want to look at, a specific research question that you think you can get data to test, where you think you might be able to get some data. It’s okay that much of this is speculative and you might change your mind or do very different things later!\n Data Description: describe what data you managed to find (a few paragraphs): where is/are the dataset(s) from? What variables are included, and how are they measured (e.g. what units, categories, etc)? Give us some summary statistics of the data (a table would be nice, some scatterplots and histograms would be nice), are there any interesting patterns?\n Literature Review: find 2-3 scholarly sources (ideally scholarly journal articles) that discuss your research question (or related topics), especially if they have empirical findings. Explain what these sources found, how they found it, and how your paper relates to this literature. Don’t worry about being original!\n Presentation: a 5-10 minute presentation of what you have so far. Different people will be at different stages, since your paper is not due yet! Use this as an opportunity to get feedback from me and your classmates, that might help you finish your project. Using some slides to show tables, models, and plots is highly recommended.

Can you summarize these in a sentence or two? Are there confusing passages, excessive jargon or passive voice, or irrelevant arguments and examples? Econometric Validity: Is your econometric model sensible and plausible? Do you adequately address the assumptions and limitations of your model? Do you use appropriate data? Do you adequately describe your data, identify patterns, aberrations, and clearly generate testable hypotheses from your data? Would someone else, given your data, be able to replicate your findings? Economic Soundness: Do you place your empirical question in a broader context of applying economic principles? Do you describe relevant economic policies, institutions, relationships, and/or other relevant economic principles to the questions you are asking? Are your theories and hypotheses about relationships between data plausible and intuitive? Do you makes sense of your hypotheses and the results of your analysis and connect them to sound economic principles? Is your question, strategy, and/or results of interest to economists? You will lose up to 20 points for papers that have no economic content. Organization: Is your paper organized? Have you presented your separate arguments/examples in a logical order? Is it clear when you are moving on from one section to another? Is it clear when and where you are summarizing and concluding? Is your paper presented according to professional norms (e.g. summary statistics tables, regression tables, etc)? References: Does your paper use multiple scholarly references? Does it properly cite them in the text for main ideas borrowed and for direct quotations (if applicable)? Are they consistently listed at the end in a references section? Style: Is your paper interesting and easy to read? Does it engage the reader? Is it written in active voice? This is somewhat subjective, and hence, the smallest portion of your grade.   Emailing Your Final Version to Me When you send your final email (by Tuesday November 22), it should contain the following files:\nYour final paper as a .pdf. It should include an abstract and bibliography and all tables and figures contained within it. The (commented!) code used for your data analysis (i.e. loading data, making tables, making plots, running regressions). These can be either .R files: one or multiple (one-per-task) are equally fine OR a .Rmd file. I want to know how you reached the results you got! Reproducibility is the goal!

Hayek (1974 Economics Nobel Laureate)\n Microeconomic Analysis is a collection of analytical tools for modeling and understanding how decisions made by agents (individuals and firms) in a context of market institutions lead to social coordination and the creation of value. This toolkit is the analytical foundation for exploring all fields and applications of economics as a social science, has many practical applications in business, finance, politics, and insights into any realm of human endeavors. Economics, after all, is the study of human action. At the intermediate level, these concepts are made more rigorous through the use of mathematical models, but we will first and foremost lay the theoretical foundations with economic intuition. As such, this class assumes you have met the required prerequisite courses by taking principles of microeconomics (ECON 206).\nCourse Format and Covid As of Fall 2021, all students are expected to be on campus except those with special approved exemptions. As such, this course will be taught in-person and synchronously until or unless otherwise announced.\n Course objectives By the end of this course, you will:\napply the models of microeconomics (constrained optimization and equilibrium) towards explaining real world behavior of individuals, firms, and governments explore the effects of economic and political processes on market performance (competition, market prices, profits and losses, property rights, entrepreneurship, market power, market failures, public policy, government failures) apply the economic way of thinking to real world issues in writing  Given these objectives, this course fulfills all three of the learning outcomes for the George B. Delaplaine, Jr. School of Business Economics B.A. program:\n Use quantitative tools and techniques in the preparation, interpretation, analysis and presentation of data and information for problem solving and decision making […] Apply economic reasoning and models to understand and analyze problems of public policy […] Demonstrate effective oral and written communications skills for personal and professional success[…]  Fair warning: Economics is hard. This, in particular, may be of the hardest courses that you will take, primarily due to the mathematical content. Using the economic way of thinking is a skill, it is literally retraining your brain to interpret and analyze the world in a novel way, and is not something that can be memorized. I will do my best to make this class intuitive and helpful, if not interesting. If at any point you find yourself struggling in this course for any reason, please come see me. Do not suffer in silence! Coming to see me for help does not diminish my view of you, in fact I will hold you in higher regard for understanding your own needs and taking charge of your own learning. There are also a some fantastic resources on campus, such as the Center for Academic Achievement and Retention (CAAR) and the Beneficial-Hodson Library.\nSee my tips for success in this course.\n Required Course materials You can find all course materials at my dedicated website for this course: microF21.classes.ryansafner.com. Links to the website are posted on our Blackboard course page. Please familiarize yourself with the website, see that it contains this syllabus, resources to help you, and our schedule. On the schedule page, you can find each module with its own class page (start there!) along with all related readings, lecture slides, practice problems, and assignments.\nMy lecture slides will be shared with you, and serve as your primary resource, but our main “textbook” below is recommended as the next best resource and will be available from the campus bookstore. I will discuss more about textbooks and materials in the first module.\nBooks Goolsbee, Austan, Steven Levitt, and Chad Syverson, 2012, Microeconomics 2nd ed, USA: Worth Publishers, ISBN: 978-1464187025  You are welcome to purchase the book by other means (e.g. Amazon, half.com, etc). I have no financial stake in requiring you to purchase this book. You are welcome to use previous version of the book, but carefully verify the reading assignments, as the material may be different across versions.\n  Assignments and Grades Your final course grade is the weighted average of the following assignments. You can find general descriptions for all the assignments on the assignments page and more specific information and examples on each assignment’s page on the schedule page.\n   Frequency  Assignment  Weight      1  Opinion-Editorial  20%    5  Homeworks  20% (using average HW grade)    3  Exams  20% (each)     Each assignment is graded on a 100 point scale. Letter-grade equivalents are based on the following scale:\n  Grade  Range  Grade  Range      A  93–100%  C  73–76%    A−  90–92%  C−  70–72%    B+  87–89%  D+  67–69%    B  83–86%  D  63–66%    B−  80–82%  D−  60–62%    C+  77–79%  F  \u0026lt; 60%     See also my  Grade Calculator app where you can calculate your overall grade using existing assignment grades and forecast “what if” scenarios.\nThese grades are firm cutoffs, but I do of course round upwards \\((\\geq\\) 0.5) for final grades. A necessary reminder, as an academic, I am not in the business of giving out grades, I merely report the grade that you earn. I will not alter your grade unless you provide a reasonable argument that I am in error (which does happen from time to time).\nSave As - PDF, or File - Export - PDF.] to **upload on Blackboard** under Assignments. You may handwrite answers if you will be able to scan/photograph \u0026 convert them **to a single PDF**, if they are easily readable, but this is *not preferred*. See my [guide to making a PDF](https://gameF21.classes.ryansafner.com/resources/#how-to-make-a-pdf-for-submitting-assignments) - an essential skill in the modern world. If you are handwriting answers, you may print the `pdf` above and write on it, or just write on a piece of paper (we only need your answers). For the few questions that ask you to draw a **graph**, *try* to do so *on your computer* (use MS Paint, the drawing tools in MS Word or MS Powerpoint, plot points in MS Excel, drawing/notetaking apps, etc.), and save it as an image to include on your homework document. Again, they need not be perfect or to scale, just show that you understand the broad idea. Being able to understand and sketch the graphs is still a very important and useful skill! If all else fails, I will be lenient in grading graph questions if you are unable to technologically include a graph. Your TA, under my supervision, will grade homeworks 70% for completion, and for the remaining 30%, and one question will be graded for accuracy - so it is best that you try every problem, even if you are unsure how to complete it accurately. ## Exams There will be three exams (one at the end of each unit) including the final exam. Each exam only covers the material in its associated unit (i.e. no exam is cumulative). These exams provide feedback both to you and to me that ensures everyone is progressing on schedule and apprehending the material. This is critical, as the rest of the course, and indeed, any future economics course you take, will build off of this foundation. Exams will be released **on Blackboard** as a timed assignment. You will have 2 hours once you open the exam on Blackboard. You will not need the whole time, I have given you some extra to accommodate the difficulties of taking an exam at home. Please pick a time to take it where you know you will have 2 hours. You may close the exam page and come back to it, but the timer will continue to run once the exam is first opened. ## Opinion-Editorial Economic fallacies have always been popular, and journalists, politicians, and talking heads consistently engage in faulty economic reasoning in print and on television. Your task, as a student of economics, is to find some issue discussed in the past year, and write a critique of media discussion of that issue. Alternatively, instead of critiquing the reasoning or statements of others, you may write an advocacy piece, where you propose some economic policy and argue to persuade readers to endorse it. You will be graded both on the soundness of your economic reasoning and the quality of your writing. I would be happy to co-author an Op-Ed with anyone who writes an exemplary Op-Ed. Students who successfully publish their work in a media outlet will earn *extra credit* on their Op-Ed grade. I will provide ample resources and examples to help you accomplish this, you can find more on the associated [assignment page](assignment/op-ed).-- No extra credit is available\n Policies and Expectations This syllabus is a contract between you, the student, and me, your instructor. It has been carefully and deliberately thought out. (A syllabus can and will be used as a legal document for disputes tried at a court of law. Ask me how I know.), and I will uphold my end of the agreement and expect you to uphold yours.\nIn the language of game theory, this syllabus is my commitment device. I am a very understanding person, and I know that exceptions to rules often need to be made for students. However, to be fair to all students the syllabus artificially constrains my ability to make exceptions at a whim for anyone. This prevents clever students from exploiting my congenial personality at everyone else’s expense. Please read and familiarize yourself with the course policies and expectations of you. Chances are, if you have a question, it is answered herein.\nLate Assignments I will accept late assignments, but will subtract a specified amount of points as a penalty. Even if it is the last week of the semester, I encourage you to turn in late work: some points are better than no points!\nHomeworks: If you turn in a homework after it is due but before it is graded or the answer key posted, I generally will not take off any points. However, if you turn in a homework after the answer key is posted, I will automatically deduct 15 points (so the maximum grade you can earn on it is an 85).\nExams: If you know that you will be unable to complete an exam as scheduled for a legitimate reason, please notify me at least one week in advance, and we will schedule a make-up exam date. Failure to do so, including desperate attempts to make arrangements only after the exam will result in a grade of 0 and little sympathy.\nOp-eds: Starting at the deadline, I will take off 1 point for every hour that your Op-ed is late.\nI reserve the right to re-weight assignments for students whom I believe are legitimately unable to complete a particular assignment.\n Grading I will try my best to post grades on Blackboard’s Grading Center and return graded assignments to you within about one week of you turning them in. There will be exceptions. Where applicable, I will post answer keys once I know most homeworks are turned in (see Late Assignments above for penalties). Blackboard’s Grading Center is the place to look for your most up-to-date grades. See also my  Grade Calculator app where you can calculate your overall grade using existing assignment grades and forecast “what if” scenarios.\n Communication: Email, Slack, and Virtual Office Hours Students must regularly monitor their Hood email accounts to receive important college information, including messages related to this class. Email through the Blackboard system is my main method of communicating announcements and deadlines regarding your assignments. Please do not reply to any automated Blackboard emails - I may not recieve it!. My Hood email (safner@hood.edu) is the best means of contacting me. I will do my best to respond within 24 hours. If I do not reply within 48 hours, do not take it personally, and feel free to send a follow up email in the very likely event that I genuinely did not see your original message.\nOur slack channel is available to all students and faculty in Economics and Business. I have invited all of my classes and advisees. It will not be extended to non-Business/Economics students or faculty. All users must use their hood emails and true first and last names. Each course has its own channel, exclusive for verified students in the course, and myself, by my invite only. As a third party platform, you agree to its Terms of Service. I have created this space as a way to stay connected, to help one another, and to foster community. Behaviors such as posting inappropriate content, harassing others, or engaging in academic dishonesty, to be determined solely at my discretion, will result in one warning, the content will be deleted, and subsequent behavior will result in a ban.\nI will host general “office hours” on Zoom. You can join in with video, audio, and/or chat, whichever you feel comfortable with. Of course, if you are not available during those times, we can schedule our own time if you prefer this method over email or Slack. If you want to go over material from class, please have specific questions you want help with. I am not in the business of giving private lectures (particularly if you missed class without a valid excuse).\nWatch this excellent and accurate video explaining office hours:\n  Netiquette When using Zoom and Slack, please follow appropriate internet etiquette (“Netiquette”). Written communications, like blog posts or use of the Zoom chat, lacks important nonverbal cues (such as body language, tone of voice, sarcasm, etc).\nAbove all else, please respect one another and think/reread carefully about how others may see your post before you submit a comment. You are expected to disagree and have different opinions, this is inherently valuable in a discussion. Please be civil and constructive in responding to others’ comments: writing “have you considered ‘X?’” is a lot more helpful to all involved than just writing “well you’re just wrong.”\nPosting content that is wilfully incindiary, illegal, or that constitutes academic dishonesty (such as plagarism) will automatically earn a grade of 0 and may be elevated to other authorities on campus.\nWhen using the chat function on Zoom or public Slack channels, please treat it as official course communications, even though I may not be grading it. It may be a quick and informal tool - don’t feel you need to worry about spelling or perfect grammar - but please try to avoid too informal “text-speak” (i.e. say “That’s good for you” instead of “thas good 4 u”).\n Privacy Maryland law requires all parties consent for a conversation or meeting to be recorded. If you join in, and certainly if you participate, you are consenting to be recorded. However, as described below, videos are not accessible beyond our class.\nLive lectures are recorded on Zoom and posted to Blackboard via Panopto, a secure course management system for video. Among other nice features (such as multiple video screens, close captioning, and time-stamped search functions!), Panopto is authenticated via your Blackboard credentials, ensuring that our course videos are not accessible to the open internet.\nFor the privacy of your peers, and to foster an environment of trust and academic freedom to explore ideas, do not record our course lectures or discussions. You are already getting my official copies.\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act prevents me from disclosing or discussing any student information, including grades and records about student performance. If the student is at least 18 years of age, parents (or spouses) do not have a right to obtain this information, except with consent by the student.\nMany of you may be tuning in remotely, living with parents, and may have occasional interruptions due to sharing a space. This is normal and fine, but know that I will protect your privacy and not discuss your performance when parents (or anyone other than you, for that matter) are present, without your explicit consent.\n Enrollment Students are responsible for verifying their enrollment in this class. The last day to add or drop this class with no penalty is Wednesday, February 10. Be aware of important dates.\n Honor Code Hood College has an Academic Honor Code which requires all members of this community to maintain the highest standards of academic honesty and integrity. Cheating, plagiarism, lying, and stealing are all prohibited. All violations of the Honor Code are taken seriously, will be reported to appropriate authority, and may result in severe penalties, including expulsion from the college. See here for more detailed information.\n Van Halen and M\u0026amp;Ms When you have completed reading the syllabus, email me a picture of the band Van Halen and a picture of a bowl of M\u0026amp;Ms. If you do this before the date of the first exam, you will get bonus points on the exam. If 75-100% of the class does this, you each get 2 points. If 50-75% of the class does this, you each get 4 points. If 25-50% of the class does this, you each get 6 points. If 0-25% of the class does this, you each get 8 points. Yes, you read this correctly.\n Accessibility, Equity, and Accommodations College courses can, and should, be challenging and bring you out of your comfort zone in a safe and equitable environment. If, however, you feel at any point in the semester that certain assignments or aspects of the course will be disproportionately uncomfortable or burdensome for you due to any factor beyond your control, please come see me or email me. I am a very understanding person and am happy to work out a solution together. I reserve the right to modify and reweight assignments at my sole discretion for students that I belive would legitimately be at a disadvantage, through no fault of their own, to complete them as described.\nIf you are unable to afford required textbooks or other resources for any reason, come see me and we can find a solution that works for you.\nThis course is intended to be accessible for all students, including those with mental, physical, or cognitive disabilities, illness, injuries, impairments, or any other condition that tends to negatively affect one’s equal access to education. If at any point in the term, you find yourself not able to fully access the space, content, and experience of this course, you are welcome to contact me to discuss your specific needs. I also encourage you to contact the Office of Accessibility Services (301-696-3421). If you have a diagnosis or history of accommodations in high school or previous postsecondary institutions, Accessibility Services can help you document your needs and create an accommodation plan. By making a plan through Accessibility Services, you can ensure appropriate accommodations without disclosing your condition or diagnosis to course instructors.\n ACBSP Information Hood College is an accredited member of the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP), an organization devoted to enhancing business education. In receiving and maintaining this accreditation, the faculty has made a commitment to the continuous improvement, innovation, and scholarship of the Department of Economics and Management. For you, this means that your educational experience undergoes ongoing validation to ensure it meets the most rigorous international standards of business education. Only a select group of institutions have received this status and it is an attribute of Hood for which you should take great pride.\nPragmatically, our accreditation means that we will engage in the ongoing use of measures, both quantitative and qualitative in nature, to assess the performance of our students and the program. We ask that you take very seriously the surveys and other measurement devices we will use – your best work and honest response will help us best assess and improve our program.\n  Tentative Schedule You can find a full schedule with much more details, including the readings, appendices, and other further resources for each class meeting on the schedule page.\n ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627240224,"objectID":"e4d5a4a79239f08c6ad0d7cbf1be756c","permalink":"https://microf21.classes.ryansafner.com/syllabus/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/syllabus/","section":"","summary":"Course Format and Covid Course objectives Required Course materials  Books  Assignments and Grades Policies and Expectations  Late Assignments Grading Communication: Email, Slack, and Virtual Office Hours Netiquette Privacy Enrollment Honor Code Accessibility, Equity, and Accommodations ACBSP Information  Tentative Schedule   Instructor  Dr. Ryan Safner  Office: Rosenstock 218-B  Office Hours: TBD  safner@hood.edu  @ryansafner   Course details  MW 2:40—4:05 PM  Rosenstock 1  Aug 23—Dec 14, 2021  Slack     Download PDF","tags":null,"title":"Syllabus","type":"page"}]
