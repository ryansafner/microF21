I try hard to make sure that I have few words on slides, and even fewer answers to problems.  My suggestion: print out my lecture slides in advance (or follow along on your device) and take additional notes by hand.   At least skim all of the readings. I give out readings for a reason, and that reason is not to bore you or waste your time. The truth is, as a beginner, you can\u0026rsquo;t rely on heuristics or memory to \u0026ldquo;fill in the blanks.\u0026rdquo; You need the readings to provide context to what I am saying in class. I cannot help you if you are not going to try. Any professor also will lose patience at short notice when it\u0026rsquo;s discovered you haven\u0026rsquo;t done the reading. Do the homeworks (if there are any). You might be surprised that I need to say this, but I do. Students that do not do the homeworks do poorly on exams, which often are similar to homework questions. Homeworks are the best practice for exams, they give you a sense of the relevant content areas that might come up, the type and style of questions that I ask, and you often get answer keys to help you \u0026ldquo;get inside my head\u0026rdquo; and study from. There is no good reason why you should have a low homework grade. Work on assignments together and study together. Recognize that you are not in this alone, and other students are just as anxious or uncertain as you are. More surprisingly, other students probably have some answers you are looking for, and you may have answers for some of their problems! You will learn better when you collaborate with others similar to you. More importantly, you don\u0026rsquo;t truly understand something unless you can explain it to others.^[Yes, that means I am doing a ton of learning every time I teach!] As a wise woman once told me \u0026ldquo;whomever is doing the talking is doing the learning.\u0026rdquo; Learn how to learn.

Please try to frame your photos properly! Put your paper flat on a solid surface (table, desk, the floor, etc). Get the whole page within the borders of the photo, and not too much background. I don\u0026rsquo;t need to see half of your desk or bed as you are taking the photo!

Finally, depending on your OS, convert the files to a PDF:\n1. On a Windows PC\nOpen the folder where your photos are currently, in the File Explorer. Select all of the photos, and right click, and select Print. In the dialog box that pops up, select Microsoft Print to PDF in the Printer box, and then click Print. This will save it as a .pdf file in that folder. See more information.\n2.

We must now enter the more controversial1 realm of modeling preferences.\nAs I mentioned in last class’ page, a lot of the “in the weeds” details about preference assumptions, indifference curves, and utility functions are a waste of your time. If you look at the textbook chapter, I am skipping a lot of “the fat,” and relegating it to an appendix at the bottom of this page.2 Again, I reiterate that if you are interested in more advanced economics training, it is essential that you master all of these details. But not for this course.\nToday we focus on the essential tools for fitting preferences into our optimization model:\n indifference curves: each of which is the set of all bundles that one is indifferent between (and that give the same amount utility) utility functions: which measure the ordinal (but not cardinal!) utility level of any given bundle; for comparisons only! marginal rate of substitution: the slope of the indifference curve, representing an individual’s subjective tradeoff between goods; measured by the ratio of marginal utilities: \\(MRS_{x,y}=-\\frac{MU_x}{MU_y}\\)   Readings   Ch. 4.1-4.2 in Goolsbee, Levitt, and Syverson, 2019  Math Review Guide   Slides \n  Download as PDF   Practice Answers from last class’ practice problems are posted on that page.\n Assignments Problem Set 1 Problem set 1 (on 1.1-1.4) is due by 11:59 PM Sunday February 14 by PDF upload to Blackboard Assignments. We will learn and practice the final few concepts this problem set covers next class.\n Appendix 1: Material on Preferences Strict vs. Weak Preferences We have defined preferences as being strictly one of the following possibilities:\n \\(a \\succ b\\) ($a$ is strictly preferred over b) \\(a \\prec b\\) ($b$ is strictly preferred over a) \\(a \\sim b\\) (indifferent between a)  You can also have weak preferences, such as\n \\(a \\succeq b\\) ($a$ is at least as preferred as (or “weakly preferred over” \\(b\\)) \\(a \\preceq b\\) ($b$ is at least as preferred as (or “weakly preferred over” \\(a\\))  These are more technically complete, but it is much more simple for us to focus on strong preferences, and we don’t lose much by doing so.\nAssumptions of “Well-behaved Preferences”   Reflexivity : any bundle is at least as preferred as itself\n  Completeness : any two bundles can be compared\n  Transitivity : rankings are logically consistent:\n   If \\(a \\succ b\\) and \\(b \\succ c\\), then \\(a \\succ c\\)  Are these good assumptions? As you will find typical in economics, very often yes, sometimes no! See the growing field of Behavioral economics for interesting anomalies and exceptions to our assumptions.\nAssumptions of “Well-behaved Indifference Curves” Like preferences, we make 4 major assumptions about indifference curves to describe the normal case. In fact, many of these assumptions are derived from the assumptions we made above about well-behaved preferences\n We can always draw indifference curves: two bundles can always be ranked  Every possible bundle (point on graph) is on an indifference curve.\nIC_10=function(x){100/x} IC_9=function(x){81/x} IC_8=function(x){64/x} IC_7=function(x){49/x} IC_6=function(x){36/x} IC_5=function(x){25/x} IC_4=function(x){16/x} IC_3=function(x){9/x} IC_2=function(x){4/x} IC_1=function(x){1/x} ggplot(data.frame(x=c(0,10)), aes(x=x))+ stat_function(fun=IC_10, geom=\u0026#34;line\u0026#34;, size=2)+ stat_function(fun=IC_9, geom=\u0026#34;line\u0026#34;, size=2)+ stat_function(fun=IC_8, geom=\u0026#34;line\u0026#34;, size=2)+ stat_function(fun=IC_7, geom=\u0026#34;line\u0026#34;, size=2)+ stat_function(fun=IC_6, geom=\u0026#34;line\u0026#34;, size=2)+ stat_function(fun=IC_5, geom=\u0026#34;line\u0026#34;, size=2)+ stat_function(fun=IC_4, geom=\u0026#34;line\u0026#34;, size=2)+ stat_function(fun=IC_3, geom=\u0026#34;line\u0026#34;, size=2)+ stat_function(fun=IC_2, geom=\u0026#34;line\u0026#34;, size=2)+ stat_function(fun=IC_1, geom=\u0026#34;line\u0026#34;, size=2)+ scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,10,1), limits=c(0,10), expand=expand_scale(mult=c(0,0.1)))+ scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,10,1), limits=c(0,10), expand=expand_scale(mult=c(0,0.1)))+ scale_color_viridis_d(0,10)+ #scale_colour_manual(\u0026#34;Curves\u0026#34;, values = line_colors, guide=F)+ labs(x = \u0026#34;x\u0026#34;, y = \u0026#34;y\u0026#34;)+ theme_classic(base_family = \u0026#34;Fira Sans Condensed\u0026#34;, base_size=20) Of course, this means that this entire graph is full of indifference curves - every single possible point is on some indifference curve (and this whole graph would just be a solid block of black). Naturally, it’s pointless to draw all the indifference curves, we just want to show a few to make our analysis meaningful. But the general idea comes from assumption 2 of preferences: any two bundles can be compared, as we can compare two points on this graph and make a judgment.\n Indifference curves are monotonic, which means practically that “more is preferred to less”  For any bundle \\(b\\) with more of at least one good than bundle \\(a \\implies a \\prec b\\). Movements to the Northeast always preferable, while movements to the Southwest always unpreferable.\npoints\u0026lt;-tribble( ~letter, ~x, ~y, \u0026#34;A\u0026#34;, 2, 2, ) asfill\u0026lt;-tibble(fx=seq(0,10,0.1), fymin=4/fx, fymax=rep(10, length(fx)) ) asfill2\u0026lt;-tibble(fx=seq(0,10,0.1), fymin=rep(0, length(fx)), fymax=4/fx ) IC_as=function(x){4/x} ggplot(data.frame(x=c(0,10)), aes(x=x))+ stat_function(fun=IC_as, geom=\u0026#34;line\u0026#34;, size=2, color=\u0026#34;blue\u0026#34;)+ geom_ribbon(data=asfill,aes(x=fx,ymin=fymin,ymax=fymax),fill=\u0026#34;green\u0026#34;, alpha=0.4)+ geom_ribbon(data=asfill2,aes(x=fx,ymin=fymin,ymax=fymax),fill=\u0026#34;red\u0026#34;, alpha=0.4)+ geom_rect(aes(xmin=0,xmax=0.4,ymin=0,ymax=10), fill=\u0026#34;red\u0026#34;, alpha=0.2)+ geom_point(data = points, mapping=aes(x=x, y=y), size = 3)+ geom_text_repel(data = points, mapping=aes(x=x, y=y, label = letter), size = 6)+ scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,10,1), limits=c(0,10), expand=expand_scale(mult=c(0,0.1)))+ scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,10,1), limits=c(0,10), expand=expand_scale(mult=c(0,0.1)))+ labs(x = \u0026#34;x\u0026#34;, y = \u0026#34;y\u0026#34;)+ theme_classic(base_family = \u0026#34;Fira Sans Condensed\u0026#34;, base_size=20) Here’s a challenge: what would indifference curves look like if one of the axes contained a bad, rather than a good? In this case, we would violate the assumption of monotonicity!\n Indifference curves are convex, which means in practice that “averages are preferred to extremes”  From experience, people generally prefer variety in their consumption. Rather than having one bundle that is “extreme” (a lot of one good and little or none of another), they tend to prefer a bundle with a better “mix” or “balance” of some of both goods.\nTake our example from class, hunting for apartments. Apartment \\(A\\) is very large but near very few friends, whereas apartment \\(B\\) is very small but near many friends. If we could find some apartment, \\(C\\), that is a weighted average of the two, with a better mix of size and friends, it would be preferred, and thus, on a higher indifference curve than \\(A\\) or \\(B\\)!\nMathematically, this feature is because indifference curves are normally convex. A function is convex when a line connecting any two points on the function lies above the function itself.

There is no tradeoff a person would make to acquire more Tickets, they truly do not care about them at all. Thus, on the right graph, Tickets would be a neutral.\nWe can look at less extreme cases:\nOn the left graph, the flatter curve implies the person is willing to give up only a few Downloads to obtain more Tickets (and vice versa). \\(MRS_{T,D}\\) (slope) is small, indicating downloads are more highly valued relative to tickets.\nOn the right graph, the steeper curve implies the person is willing to give up a lot Downloads to obtain more Tickets (and vice versa). \\(MRS_{T,D}\\) (slope) is large, indicating downloads are less valued relative to tickets.\n Math Appendix Derivation of MRS Equation (as ratio of marginal utilities) Consider a movement along an indifference curve, how would this change affect utility? There will be a change in \\(x\\) and a change in \\(y\\), and multiplying the marginal utility of each, and adding these together will give us our total change in utility. But we know that if we are on the same indifference curve, moving along the curve will not change utility (all points on the curve are defined as having the same utility!). So rearrange the equation as follows:\n$$\\begin{align*} MU_x \\Delta x+MU_y\\Delta y\u0026amp;= \\Delta u \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Measuring change in utility} \\\\ MU_x \\Delta x+MU_y \\Delta y \u0026amp;=0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{But change in utility is 0}\\\\ MU_y \\Delta y\u0026amp;= -MU_{x} \\Delta x \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Subtracting x terms}\\\\ \\underbrace{\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}}_{MRS} \u0026amp;= -\\frac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Dividing to get like terms on each side}\\\\ \\end{align*}$$\nNotice rise over run, \\(\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\), is the slope, which we have defined as the marginal rate of substitution (MRS). \\(\\blacksquare\\)\nUtility Functions and PMTs Two utility functions \\(u(\\cdot)\\) and \\(v(\\cdot)\\) represent the same preferences iff there is a strictly increasing function \\(f\\) such that \\(v(\\cdot)=f\\left[u(\\cdot)\\right]\\)\n$$\\begin{aligned} a\u0026amp;=(1,2)\\\\ b\u0026amp;=(2,2)\\\\ c\u0026amp;=(4,3)\\\\ \\end{aligned}$$\nThe following utility functions express the same preferences:\n   \\(u(\\cdot)\\) \\(v(\\cdot)\\)     \\(u(a)=1\\) \\(v(a)=2\\)   \\(u(b)=2\\) \\(v(b)=4\\)   \\(u(c)=3\\) \\(v(c)=6\\)    $$v(\\cdot)=2\\left[u(\\cdot)\\right]$$\nA positive monotonic transformation (PMT) transforms quantities such that the rank order of the quantities is preserved.\n Examples: \\(v(u)=u+2; \\, v(u)=4u; \\, v(u)=u^3; \\, v(u)=ln(u)\\)  Any PMT of a utility function contains the same preferences!\nGraphing Indifference Curves I will not ask you to formally graph indifference curves (just roughly sketch them where appropriate). If you wanted to graph them, and express them in a graphable (slope-intercept form) equation, simply solve for the good on the vertical axis.\nExample: Suppose we have a typical3 indifference curve for apples \\((a)\\) and bananas \\((b)\\): $$u(a,b)=ab$$\nlibrary(\u0026#34;plotly\u0026#34;) x_vec = seq(0,10,1) y_vec = seq(0,10,1) x_matrix = matrix(c(x_vec), nrow = 10, ncol = 1) y_matrix = matrix(c(y_vec), nrow = 1, ncol = 10) z_matrix = matrix(c(x_matrix %*% y_matrix),nrow=10,ncol=10) plot_ly(x = x_vec, y = y_vec, z = z_matrix) %\u0026gt;% add_surface() %\u0026gt;% layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title=\u0026#34;a\u0026#34;), yaxis = list(title=\u0026#34;b\u0026#34;), zaxis = list(title=\u0026#34;Utility\u0026#34;)))  {\"x\":{\"visdat\":{\"696d40229612\":[\"function () \",\"plotlyVisDat\"]},\"cur_data\":\"696d40229612\",\"attrs\":{\"696d40229612\":{\"x\":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],\"y\":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],\"z\":[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],[0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18],[0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27],[0,4,8,12,16,20,24,28,32,36],[0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45],[0,6,12,18,24,30,36,42,48,54],[0,7,14,21,28,35,42,49,56,63],[0,8,16,24,32,40,48,56,64,72],[0,9,18,27,36,45,54,63,72,81]],\"alpha_stroke\":1,\"sizes\":[10,100],\"spans\":[1,20],\"type\":\"surface\",\"inherit\":true}},\"layout\":{\"margin\":{\"b\":40,\"l\":60,\"t\":25,\"r\":10},\"scene\":{\"xaxis\":{\"title\":\"a\"},\"yaxis\":{\"title\":\"b\"},\"zaxis\":{\"title\":\"Utility\"}},\"hovermode\":\"closest\",\"showlegend\":false,\"legend\":{\"yanchor\":\"top\",\"y\":0.5}},\"source\":\"A\",\"config\":{\"showSendToCloud\":false},\"data\":[{\"colorbar\":{\"title\":\"\",\"ticklen\":2,\"len\":0.5,\"lenmode\":\"fraction\",\"y\":1,\"yanchor\":\"top\"},\"colorscale\":[[\"0\",\"rgba(68,1,84,1)\"],[\"0.0416666666666667\",\"rgba(70,19,97,1)\"],[\"0.0833333333333333\",\"rgba(72,32,111,1)\"],[\"0.125\",\"rgba(71,45,122,1)\"],[\"0.166666666666667\",\"rgba(68,58,128,1)\"],[\"0.208333333333333\",\"rgba(64,70,135,1)\"],[\"0.25\",\"rgba(60,82,138,1)\"],[\"0.291666666666667\",\"rgba(56,93,140,1)\"],[\"0.333333333333333\",\"rgba(49,104,142,1)\"],[\"0.375\",\"rgba(46,114,142,1)\"],[\"0.416666666666667\",\"rgba(42,123,142,1)\"],[\"0.458333333333333\",\"rgba(38,133,141,1)\"],[\"0.5\",\"rgba(37,144,140,1)\"],[\"0.541666666666667\",\"rgba(33,154,138,1)\"],[\"0.583333333333333\",\"rgba(39,164,133,1)\"],[\"0.625\",\"rgba(47,174,127,1)\"],[\"0.666666666666667\",\"rgba(53,183,121,1)\"],[\"0.708333333333333\",\"rgba(79,191,110,1)\"],[\"0.75\",\"rgba(98,199,98,1)\"],[\"0.791666666666667\",\"rgba(119,207,85,1)\"],[\"0.833333333333333\",\"rgba(147,214,70,1)\"],[\"0.875\",\"rgba(172,220,52,1)\"],[\"0.916666666666667\",\"rgba(199,225,42,1)\"],[\"0.958333333333333\",\"rgba(226,228,40,1)\"],[\"1\",\"rgba(253,231,37,1)\"]],\"showscale\":true,\"x\":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],\"y\":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],\"z\":[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],[0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18],[0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27],[0,4,8,12,16,20,24,28,32,36],[0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45],[0,6,12,18,24,30,36,42,48,54],[0,7,14,21,28,35,42,49,56,63],[0,8,16,24,32,40,48,56,64,72],[0,9,18,27,36,45,54,63,72,81]],\"type\":\"surface\",\"frame\":null}],\"highlight\":{\"on\":\"plotly_click\",\"persistent\":false,\"dynamic\":false,\"selectize\":false,\"opacityDim\":0.2,\"selected\":{\"opacity\":1},\"debounce\":0},\"shinyEvents\":[\"plotly_hover\",\"plotly_click\",\"plotly_selected\",\"plotly_relayout\",\"plotly_brushed\",\"plotly_brushing\",\"plotly_clickannotation\",\"plotly_doubleclick\",\"plotly_deselect\",\"plotly_afterplot\",\"plotly_sunburstclick\"],\"base_url\":\"https://plot.ly\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]} Each indifference curve (or contour) is one level of utility (all points on the curve give a specific level of utility).

A straight line has a constant slope, which is interpretted as the MRS being constant - you should always be willing to substitute between the two goods at the same rate. The utility function looks like:\n$$u(x,y)=w_xx+w_yy$$\nWhere each \\(w_i\\) is a relative weight (intensity of relative preference). These are often known as linear preferences because the utility of the two goods are related by addition.\nNotice, having some of one good and none of the other still provides positive utility (unlike utility functions where the quantities of goods are multiplied!). This is precisely because of the substitutability between the goods!\nExample Consider 1-Liter bottles of Coke \\(L_{1}\\) and 2-Liter bottles of Coke \\(L_{2}\\). You should always be willing to substitute between one 2-Liter bottle and two 1-Liter bottles.\n$$u_{L_{1},L_{2}}=1L_{1}+2L_{2}$$\nThe relative weights here are 1 for 1-Liter bottles and 2 for 2-Liter bottles, because 2-Liter bottles are “worth” twice as much for you (it takes two 1-Liter bottles to match a 2-Liter bottle!).\n\\(MRS_{L_{1},L_{2}}=-\\frac{w_x}{w_y} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\)\nUtility Functions for Perfect Complements Perfect complements produce right angles for indifference curves. This is technically not a mathematical function, since each \\(X\\) value must be mapped to a single \\(Y\\) value (i.e. no vertical lines). Thus, the utility function for perfect complements \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is quite unique:\n$$u(x,y)=min\\{w_xx,w_yy\\}$$\nWhere each \\(w_i\\) is a relative weight (intensity of relative preference). Utility is determined by the lesser value of what you have, \\(x\\) (weighted by \\(w_x\\)) or \\(y\\) (weighted by \\(w_y\\)). These are sometimes called “Leontief preferences.”\nThe marginal rate of substitution alternates between \\(0\\) (horizontal line) and \\(\\infty\\) (vertical line).\nExample Consider consuming hot dogs \\((H)\\) and buns \\((B)\\), that must be consumed together as a package 1:1. The utility function would be: $$u(H,B)=min\\{H,B\\}$$\nHaving 2 hot dogs and 3 buns only yields a utility of 2. Having 3 hot dogs and 2 buns also only yields a utility of 2.\nCobb-Douglas Functions Cobb-Douglas functions (both for utility and production) are one of the most common functional forms in economics.

Economics at the graduate and professional level begins with abstract models of \\(n\\) number of goods in an economy. Naturally, we cannot graph this, so we must deal in abstract equations and set theory:\nLet \\(\\{x_1, x_2, \\cdots, x_n\\}\\) denote the set of \\(n\\) goods in an economy. Let \\(\\{p_1,p_2, \\cdots, p_n\\}\\) denote the set of market prices affiliated with each good. Let \\(m\\) again denote an individual\u0026rsquo;s income.\nFor \\(n\\) goods, the budget set is defined as:\n$$p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 + \\cdots + p_n x_n \\leq m$$\nWhich we can simplify, using summation notation, as:\n$$ \\sum^{n}_{i=1}p_ix_i \\leq m $$\nTo get the limit of this set, the budget constraint, make it an equality:\n$$\\sum^{n}_{i=1}p_ix_i = m$$ As usual, this simply says that one\u0026rsquo;s total expenditures (on all goods) on the left-hand side, must be equal to one\u0026rsquo;s income on the right-hand side.\n","date":1591574400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1626806509,"objectID":"cd506b44bcc0aabb646b0a5ad89c6386","permalink":"https://microf21.classes.ryansafner.com/content/1.2-content/","publishdate":"2020-06-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/content/1.2-content/","section":"content","summary":"Monday, February 1, 2021   Overview We are diving right into what is commonly called \u0026ldquo;Consumer Theory\u0026rdquo; in textbooks.

To solve the problem the “traditional way” would be to use Lagrangian multipliers and calculus and solve for the first order conditions.1 We instead will find the solution by looking graphically, and use an algebraic rule that should make a lot of intuitive sense. That rule, equivalently expressed in two ways:\n\\[ \\begin{align*}\\frac{MU_x}{MU_y} \u0026amp;= \\frac{p_x}{p_y}\\\\ \\frac{MU_x}{p_x} \u0026amp;= \\frac{MU_y}{p_y}\\\\ \\end{align*} \\] The first rule states that the slope of the indifference curve (left) equals the slope of the budget constraint (right). This is stating that the marginal benefit of consuming \\(x\\) (left) equals the marginal cost (right) of consuming \\(y\\), and that the individual is trading off \\(y\\) for \\(x\\) at the same rate as the market is.\nThe second (version of the) rule, solved for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms on either side, shows that the marginal utility per dollar spent is equal across both (all) goods.\nBoth forms are often called the equimarginal rule, that at the optimum choice, the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost (which is the marginal benefit of the next best foregone opportunity).\nWe will do some practice to make sure you can solve this type of model, and then you are fully prepared for Problem Set 1.\n  Readings   Ch. 4.4-4.5 in Goolsbee, Levitt, and Syverson, 2019  Math Review Guide    Slides \n  Download as PDF    Practice Today we will be working on practice problems.

Find the consumer’s optimum consumption bundle.\nThe problem can be expressed as\n\\[\\max_{x,y} xy\\] \\[s. t. 5x+10y=50\\]\nThere are a few strategies you can use to solve this problem using calculus.\nSubstitution Method: take the budget constraint and solve it for one good in terms of the other good and income. Let’s solve for \\(x\\):\n\\[\\begin{align*} 5x+10y\u0026amp;=50 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{The budget constraint}\\\\ 5x\u0026amp;=50-10y \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Subtracting } 10y \\text{ from both sides}\\\\ x\u0026amp;=10-2y \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Dividing both sides by 5}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nNow we can plug this in for \\(x\\) in the utility function to get an unconstrained maximization problem:\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\max_{y} (10-2y)y \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Plugging into the original utility function}\\\\ \\max_{y} 10y-2y^2 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Distributing the }y\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nThen we take the derivative with respect to \\(y\\) and set it equal to zero to find the maximum value of \\(y\\) in the function.\n\\[\\begin{align*} u\u0026amp;=10y-2y^2 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{The new utility function}\\\\ \\frac{d u}{d y} = 10-4y\u0026amp;=0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Taking the first derivative} \\\\ 10\u0026amp;=4y \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Adding } 4y \\text{ to both sides}\\\\ 2.5\u0026amp;=y \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Dividing both sides by } 4\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nNow that we know \\(y\\) is 2.5. To find \\(x\\), plug 2.5 in for \\(y\\) in the first equation we found from the budget constraint:\n\\[\\begin{align*} x\u0026amp;=10-2y \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{The equation}\\\\ x\u0026amp;=10-2(2.5) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Plugging in 2.5}\\\\ x\u0026amp;=10-5 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Distributing the -2}\\\\ x\u0026amp;=5 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Simplifying}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nSo we’ve found the optimal bundle is 5 of \\(x\\) and 2.5 of \\(y\\), or (\\(x^*,y^*)=(5,2.5)\\).\nLagrangian Method: Recall the Lagrangian adds the objective function and the Lagrange multiplier \\((\\lambda)\\) times the constraint set equal to 0:\n\\[\\max_{x, y, \\lambda} \\Lambda(x, y, \\lambda)=xy+\\lambda(5x+10y-50)\\]\nSolving for the First Order Conditions (setting all partial derivatives to 0):\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{\\partial \\Lambda}{\\partial x} \u0026amp;= y+5\\lambda \u0026amp;= 0 \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\Lambda}{\\partial y} \u0026amp;= x+10\\lambda \u0026amp;= 0 \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\Lambda}{\\partial \\lambda} \u0026amp;= 5x+10y-50 \u0026amp;= 0 \\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nTaking the first two equations, and rearranging each to equal \\(\\lambda\\):\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{y}{5}\u0026amp;=\\lambda \\\\ \\frac{x}{10}\u0026amp;=\\lambda \\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nSetting them equal to one another, and solving for \\(x\\):\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{y}{5}\u0026amp;=\\frac{x}{10} \\\\ 2y\u0026amp;=x \\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nSo the consumer will buy twice the amount of \\(y\\) as \\(x\\) (note this should be intuitive as \\(y\\) costs twice as much as \\(x\\)!). To find the exact amounts of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) she will buy, plug what we just found into the budget constraint:\n\\[\\begin{align*} 5(2y)+10y\u0026amp;=50 \\\\ 20y\u0026amp;=50 \\\\ y\u0026amp;=2.5 \\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nSince we now know \\(y^*\\), we can find \\(x^*\\):\n\\[\\begin{align*} x\u0026amp;=2y\\\\ x\u0026amp;=2(2.5)=5 \\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nSo the optimum consumption bundle (\\(x^*, y^*\\)) again is (5,2.5).\nYou may be asking: so what in the world is \\(\\lambda\\)? Besides being instrumental in solving constrained optimization problems, the Lagrangian multiplier \\(\\lambda\\) does have some economic interpretation. First, let’s return to the FOCs, knowing \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), to solve for \\(\\lambda\\):\n\\[\\begin{align*} y+5\\lambda \u0026amp;=0\\\\ 2.5+5\\lambda \u0026amp;=0\\\\ \\lambda \u0026amp;=0.5 \\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nMathematically, it can be proved that \\(\\lambda=\\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial u(x,y)}{\\partial m}\\): the rate of instantaneous change in your objective function with respect to your constraint (i.e. your income). That is, if you were to change your constraint (i.e. your income) by one unit, \\(\\lambda\\) tells us how much your objective function would increase (in units of the objective function).\nEconomically, it is known as the “shadow price,” or sometimes the “marginal utility of wealth.” It tells us how much your utility would increase if you were able to increase your constraint (income) by one unit (e.g. $1). Alternatively, we can think of it as the marginal benefit of relaxing the constraint (having $1 more to spend), or the marginal cost of strengthening the constraint (having $1 less).\nIn our example, \\(\\lambda=0.5\\), so if we had one +(-)$1 in income to spend, utility would increase(decrease) by 0.5.\nRecall that since utility is ordinal and not cardinal, the number of “utils” your utility were to change by is meaningless. \\(\\lambda\\) does have meaningful quantitative interpretations when we use constrained optimization to talk about production, where units are dollars and output, rather than dollars and utility.\nLet’s lastly confirm that this is the optimum using the definition\n\\[\\begin{align*} |MRS| \u0026amp;= |\\frac{p_x}{p_y}| \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{At the optimum, slopes of I.C. and B.C. are equal}\\\\ \\frac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}}\u0026amp;=\\frac{p_x}{p_y} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Definition of each slope}\\\\ \\frac{y}{x} \u0026amp;= \\frac{p_x}{p_y} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{MU\u0026#39;s for this specific utility function}\\\\ \\frac{(2.5)}{(5)} \u0026amp;= \\frac{5}{10} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{At optimum, } y=2.5, x=5\\\\ \\frac{1}{2} \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{2} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\checkmark \\end{align*}\\]\n  General Case for \\(n\\) Goods \u0026amp; Marshallian Demand Functions In the case of \\(n\\) number of goods (from good \\(x_1\\) to \\(x_n)\\), the optimal consumption portfolio solves the utility maximization problem:\n\\(\\max_{x_1,\\cdots,n_n}U(x_1,\\cdots, x_n)\\) \\(s.t. \\sum^{n}_{i=1} x_ip_i \\leq m\\)\nThat is, as usual, choosing the consumption bundle that maximizes utility, subject to the budget constraint.\nUsing the Lagrangian method, the Lagrangian is:\n\\[\\mathbb{L} = U(x_i, \\cdots, x_n)+\\lambda(M - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_ip_i)\\]\nThe first order conditions are a series of \\(n+1\\) equations, with \\(n+1\\) unknowns:\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_1} \u0026amp;= \\lambda p_i\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_n} \u0026amp;= \\lambda p_n\\\\ \\sum^{n}_{i=1} x_ip_i \u0026amp;= m\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nSolving for each individual \\(x_i^*\\) gives us a Marshallian Demand System:\n\\[\\begin{align*} x_1^* \u0026amp;= x_1^M(p_1,\\cdots,p_n,m)\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ x_n^* \u0026amp;= x_n^M(p_1,\\cdots,p_n,m)\\\\ \\lambda^* \u0026amp;= \\lambda^M(p_1,\\cdots,p_n,m)\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nEach equation here is a demand function for that respective good, as a function of all market prices \\((p_1, \\cdots, p_n)\\) and income \\(m\\).\n   Take the full Lagrangian equation and solve for all partial derivatives, set equal to 0.↩︎\n   ","date":1591574400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1626806509,"objectID":"4540fc3f8475c42ad4480a1f06fa9590","permalink":"https://microf21.classes.ryansafner.com/content/1.4-content/","publishdate":"2020-06-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/content/1.4-content/","section":"content","summary":"Overview  Readings  Slides  Practice  Assignments  Problem Set 1 Due Wed Feb 17   Math Appendix  Solving the Constrained Optimization Problem with Calculus  Example  General Case for \\(n\\) Goods \u0026amp; Marshallian Demand Functions     Section 1: Wednesday, February 10, 2021 Section 2: Thursday, February 11, 2021   Overview Today we put all of our tools together thus far to solve the consumer’s constrained optimization problem.","tags":null,"title":"1.4 — Utility Maximization — Class Content","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"    Overview  Readings  Slides  Practice  Assignments  Problem Set 1 Due Wed Feb 17 Problem Set 2 Due Sun Feb 28 Exam 1 Week of Mar 1     Section 1: Monday, February 15, 2021 Section 2: Tuesday, February 16, 2021   Overview Solving a one-time constrained optimum problem might be useful in certain contexts, but the dynamics of change are far more interesting and useful: how do people optimally respond to changes in constraints?

While in truth, many things factor into one’s demand for a good, we are simplifying the model to relate a person’s quantity demanded of a good to three things: the price of that good (“own” price), the price of other goods, and the person’s income. When we look only at the relationship between quantity demanded and the good’s price (holding constant the other two things — other prices, and income), this is the familiar demand curve you see on supply and demand graphs from principles.\nToday, we look only at how changes in income or changes in the prices of other goods can affect your quantity demanded for a good.\nIn doing so, we also introduce a major empirical tool that we will return to many times: an elasticity. You’ve seen one elasticity before: the price elasticity of demand, and probably calculated it using the “midpoint formula.” There’s a lot more to elasticity (and a lot of other kinds of elasticities!) than that. We will see two varieties today, and will spend most of a lecture on price elasticity, two class periods from now.\nToday we will be working on practice problems.

There will be no video to watch — we will have our next class meeting until Tuesday, February 23.\n Overview Today we cover the third effect in the individual demand function: the (own) price effect, aka the law of demand: how changes in a good’s (own) price affect quantity demanded for that good.\nWe introduce the idea of (simplified, own-price) demand functions, inverse demand functions, and a demand curve. I will also show you examples of how we derive demand functions and curves.\nThe other major concept today is breaking apart the law of demand into two effects: the (real) income effect, and the substitution effect. We considering them conceptually and graphically. These can be a difficult concept for students to grasp.\n  Readings   Ch. 2.2, 5.3, in Goolsbee, Levitt, and Syverson, 2019    Slides \n  Download as PDF   Interactive Examples  Visualizing the Consumer’s Problem Visualizing Changes in the Consumer’s Problem Visualizing Demand Shifters  These are examples that I wrote in R/Shiny in the past, to visualize what it is we are looking at. As I find more time, I will update these and integrate them into our slides, but until then, I will just post links.\nThe first is a visual example of the static (one-time) Consumer’s problem. You can adjust things about the (Cobb-Douglas) utility function, income, and prices, and see how it would affect the graph and the optimum.\nThe second is a visual example of dynamic changes in the Consumer’s problem. The consumer starts at a pre-defined optimum. You can adjust any of the budget constraint parameters \\((m, p_x, p_y)\\), and see how it would affect a new optimum, which you can compare the the original optimum.\nThe third is a visual example of a hypothetical demand function for beer, with preference intensity, income, price of nachos (a complement), and price of wine (a substitute) as inputs to the function. Based on some pre-defined functions (in the background), you can change any of the inputs and see how it would affect the (inverse) demand function, expressed as a simple demand curve.\nI hope some time to clean these up and make a few more, such as “Visualizing the Income and Substitution Effects” and “Estimating a Demand Function from Real World Data.”\n  Assignments Problem Set 1 Due Problem set 1 is due by PDF upload to Blackboard Assignments.\n Problem Set 2 Due Sun Feb 28 Problem set 2 (on classes 1.6-1.8) is due by 11:59 PM Sunday, February 28 by PDF upload to Blackboard Assignments.\n Exam 1 Week of Mar 1 If you see on the schedule, we will quickly complete the materials needed for Exam 1.

The first two cases are known as “corner solutions,” where a consumer chooses all of one good, and none of another. Note perfect substitutes are not convex, and violate the assumption that “averages are preferred to extremes.”\nWe can therefore write the demand function for good x (and similarly for y):\n\\[q_d^x = \\begin{cases} \\frac{m}{p_x} \u0026amp; \\text{When } p_x \u0026lt; p_y\\\\ \\text{any number between 0 and } \\frac{m}{p_x} \u0026amp; \\text{When } p_x=p_y\\\\ 0 \u0026amp; \\text{When } p_x \u0026gt; p_y\\\\ \\end{cases}\\]\n Perfect Complements Recall that perfect complements have indifference curves that are right angles, and have a utility function of: \\[u(x,y)=\\min \\{w_1x,w_2y\\}\\]\nThe optimal choice must always be at the corner of the indifference “curves.”\nlibrary(\u0026quot;mosaic\u0026quot;) library(\u0026quot;ggrepel\u0026quot;) update_geom_defaults(\u0026quot;label\u0026quot;, list(family = \u0026quot;Fira Sans Condensed\u0026quot;)) BC_c=function(x){6-x} point_comp\u0026lt;-tribble( ~letter, ~x, ~y, \u0026quot;A\u0026quot;, 3, 3 ) ggplot(data.frame(x=c(0,5)), aes(x=x))+ stat_function(fun=BC_c, geom=\u0026quot;line\u0026quot;, size=2, color = \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;)+ geom_label(aes(x=1,y=BC_c(1)), color = \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;, label=\u0026quot;BC\u0026quot;, size = 6)+ geom_segment(aes(x=2, xend=2, y=10, yend=2), size=1, color=\u0026quot;#453781FF\u0026quot;)+ geom_segment(aes(x=2, xend=10, y=2, yend=2), size=1, color=\u0026quot;#453781FF\u0026quot;)+ geom_segment(aes(x=3, xend=3, y=10, yend=3), size=1, color=\u0026quot;#20A387FF\u0026quot;)+ geom_segment(aes(x=3, xend=10, y=3, yend=3), size=1, color=\u0026quot;#20A387FF\u0026quot;)+ geom_label(aes(x=9, y=2), size=6, color=\u0026quot;#453781FF\u0026quot;, label=\u0026quot;u=2\u0026quot;)+ geom_label(aes(x=9, y=3), size=6, color=\u0026quot;#20A387FF\u0026quot;, label=\u0026quot;u=3\u0026quot;)+ geom_point(data = point_comp, mapping=aes(x=x, y=y), size = 4)+ geom_text_repel(data = point_comp, mapping=aes(x=x, y=y, label = letter), size = 6)+ scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,10,1), limits=c(0,10), expand=expand_scale(mult=c(0,0.1)))+ scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,10,1), limits=c(0,10), expand=expand_scale(mult=c(0,0.1)))+ labs(x = \u0026quot;x\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;y\u0026quot;, title = \u0026quot;Optimal Consumption for Complements\u0026quot;, caption = expression(paste(u(x,y)==min(x,y), \u0026quot;, \u0026quot;, m, \u0026quot; = $20.00, \u0026quot;, p[x],\u0026quot; = $2.50, \u0026quot;, p[u],\u0026quot; = $2.50\u0026quot;, sep=\u0026quot; \u0026quot;)))+ theme_classic(base_family = \u0026quot;Fira Sans Condensed\u0026quot;, base_size=20) The consumer is purchasing equal amounts of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in this example, no matter what the prices are of either, so \\(x=y\\). We must satisfy the budget constraint, that \\(p_xx+p_yx=m\\) (recall \\(y=x\\)). Solving this for \\(x\\) gives us the demand function for good x:\n\\[q_D^x=q_D^y=\\frac{m}{p_x+p_y}\\]\nThis should be intuitive: the consumer must always purchase equal amounts of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), so it’s as if the consumer was spending all of their income on a single good \\((x+y)\\) that has a price of \\((p_x+p_y)\\).\n  Cobb-Douglas Now we come to a more realistic demand function. If a consumer has a Cobb-Douglas utility function1 \\[u(x,y)= a \\ln x+ b \\ln y\\]\nThen we are solving the following constrained optimization problem:\n\\[\\max_{x,y} a \\ln x + b \\ln y\\] \\[\\text{subject to } p_xx+p_yy=m\\]\nI will solve this using the Lagrangian method.2\n\\[\\mathbb{L}=a \\: ln \\: x + b \\: ln \\: y - \\lambda(p_x x + p_y y - m)\\]\nThe First Order Conditions are:\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbb{L}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{a}{x}-\\lambda p_x \u0026amp;= 0\\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbb{L}}{\\partial y} = \\frac{b}{y}-\\lambda p_y \u0026amp;= 0\\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbb{L}}{\\partial \\lambda} = p_xx+p_yy-m \u0026amp;= 0\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nRearranging the first two FOCs:\n\\[\\begin{align*} a\u0026amp;=\\lambda p_x x\\\\ b\u0026amp;=\\lambda p_y y\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nAdding them together:\n\\[\\begin{align*} a+b\u0026amp;=\\lambda(p_xx+p_yy)\\\\ a+b\u0026amp;=\\lambda m\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nSolving for \\(\\lambda\\):\n\\[\\lambda=\\frac{a+b}{m}\\]\nSubstitute this back into each of the first two FOCs and solve for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), respectively, to get:\n\\[\\begin{align*} x\u0026amp;=\\frac{a}{a+b}\\frac{m}{p_x}\\\\ y\u0026amp;=\\frac{b}{a+b} \\frac{m}{p_y}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nThese are the demand functions for goods \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). One of the convenient properties of Cobb-Douglas preferences is that a consumer spends a constant fraction of income \\((\\frac{a}{a+b})\\) on good \\(x\\), and the complement fraction \\((\\frac{b}{a+b})\\) on good \\(y\\)!^This becomes especially simple when the exponents \\(a+b=1\\), as in:\n\\[u(x,y)=x^ay^{(1-a)} \\quad \\quad \\text{where 0 \u0026lt; a \u0026lt; 1}\\]\nSo \\(a\\) and \\(1-a\\) are proportions of \\(m\\)!]\nFor a constant value of \\(p_x\\), this is a linear function of \\(m\\).

There will be no video to watch — we will have our next class meeting until Tuesday, February 23.\n Overview Today we cover the third effect in the individual demand function: the (own) price effect, aka the law of demand: how changes in a good\u0026rsquo;s (own) price affect quantity demanded for that good.\nWe introduce the idea of (simplified, own-price) demand functions, inverse demand functions, and a demand curve. I will also show you examples of how we derive demand functions and curves.\nThe other major concept today is breaking apart the law of demand into two effects: the (real) income effect, and the substitution effect. We considering them conceptually and graphically. These can be a difficult concept for students to grasp.\n Readings   Ch. 2.2, 5.3, in Goolsbee, Levitt, and Syverson, 2019   Slides \n  Download as PDF  Interactive Examples  Visualizing the Consumer\u0026rsquo;s Problem Visualizing Changes in the Consumer\u0026rsquo;s Problem Visualizing Demand Shifters  These are examples that I wrote in R/Shiny in the past, to visualize what it is we are looking at. As I find more time, I will update these and integrate them into our slides, but until then, I will just post links.\nThe first is a visual example of the static (one-time) Consumer\u0026rsquo;s problem. You can adjust things about the (Cobb-Douglas) utility function, income, and prices, and see how it would affect the graph and the optimum.\nThe second is a visual example of dynamic changes in the Consumer\u0026rsquo;s problem. The consumer starts at a pre-defined optimum. You can adjust any of the budget constraint parameters \\((m, p_x, p_y)\\), and see how it would affect a new optimum, which you can compare the the original optimum.\nThe third is a visual example of a hypothetical demand function for beer, with preference intensity, income, price of nachos (a complement), and price of wine (a substitute) as inputs to the function. Based on some pre-defined functions (in the background), you can change any of the inputs and see how it would affect the (inverse) demand function, expressed as a simple demand curve.\nI hope some time to clean these up and make a few more, such as \u0026ldquo;Visualizing the Income and Substitution Effects\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Estimating a Demand Function from Real World Data.\u0026rdquo;\n Assignments Problem Set 1 Due Problem set 1 is due by PDF upload to Blackboard Assignments.\nProblem Set 2 Due Sun Feb 28 Problem set 2 (on classes 1.6-1.8) is due by 11:59 PM Sunday, February 28 by PDF upload to Blackboard Assignments.\nExam 1 Week of Mar 1 If you see on the schedule, we will quickly complete the materials needed for Exam 1. Expect it to be the week of March 1, with more details coming by early next week.\n Appendix Example Demand Functions The examples below show how we can take a utility function and derive a demand function.\nPerfect Substitutes Recall that perfect substitutes have indifference curves that are straight lines (constant MRS), and have a utility function of: $$u(x,y)=w_1x+w_2y$$\nSince both the budget constraint and the indifference curves are straight lines, we will not have a point of tangency between them, but a point(s) where the lines intersect.\nlibrary(\u0026#34;mosaic\u0026#34;) library(\u0026#34;ggrepel\u0026#34;) update_geom_defaults(\u0026#34;label\u0026#34;, list(family = \u0026#34;Fira Sans Condensed\u0026#34;)) IC_s1=function(x){6-x} IC_s2=function(x){8-x} IC_s3=function(x){10-x} BC=function(x){4-0.5*x} point_sub\u0026lt;-tribble( ~letter, ~x, ~y, \u0026#34;A\u0026#34;, 8, 0 ) #colors\u0026lt;-c(\u0026#34;b=50/a\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;#20A387FF\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;b=25/a\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;#39568CFF\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;b=10/a\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;#39568CFF\u0026#34;) ggplot(data.frame(x=c(0,10)), aes(x=x))+ stat_function(fun=IC_s1, geom=\u0026#34;line\u0026#34;, size=2, color = \u0026#34;#481567FF\u0026#34;)+ stat_function(fun=IC_s2, geom=\u0026#34;line\u0026#34;, size=2, color = \u0026#34;#39568CFF\u0026#34;)+ stat_function(fun=IC_s3, geom=\u0026#34;line\u0026#34;, size=2, color = \u0026#34;#20A387FF\u0026#34;)+ stat_function(fun=BC, geom=\u0026#34;line\u0026#34;, size=2, color = \u0026#34;red\u0026#34;)+ geom_label(aes(x=2,y=IC_s1(2)), color = \u0026#34;#481567FF\u0026#34;, label=\u0026#34;u=6\u0026#34;, size = 6)+ geom_label(aes(x=2,y=IC_s2(2)), color = \u0026#34;#39568CFF\u0026#34;, label=\u0026#34;u=8\u0026#34;, size = 6)+ geom_label(aes(x=2,y=IC_s3(2)), color = \u0026#34;#20A387FF\u0026#34;, label=\u0026#34;u=10\u0026#34;, size = 6)+ geom_label(aes(x=1,y=BC(1)), color = \u0026#34;red\u0026#34;, label=\u0026#34;BC\u0026#34;, size = 6)+ geom_point(data = point_sub, mapping=aes(x=x, y=y), size = 4)+ geom_text_repel(data = point_sub, mapping=aes(x=x, y=y, label = letter), size = 6)+ scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,10,1), limits=c(0,10), expand=expand_scale(mult=c(0,0.1)))+ scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,10,1), limits=c(0,10), expand=expand_scale(mult=c(0,0.1)))+ coord_cartesian(clip=\u0026#34;off\u0026#34;)+ labs(x = \u0026#34;a\u0026#34;, y = \u0026#34;b\u0026#34;, title = \u0026#34;Optimal Consumption for Substitutes\u0026#34;, caption = expression(paste(u(x,y)==x+y, \u0026#34;, \u0026#34;, m, \u0026#34; = $20.00, \u0026#34;, p[x],\u0026#34; = $2.50, \u0026#34;, p[y],\u0026#34; = $5.00\u0026#34;, sep=\u0026#34; \u0026#34;)))+ theme_classic(base_family = \u0026#34;Fira Sans Condensed\u0026#34;, base_size=20) There are three possible cases,\n if \\(p_x\u0026gt;p_y\\), the slope of the budget constraint is flatter than the slope of the indifference \u0026ldquo;curves.\u0026rdquo; The optimal bundle is spending all income on good \\(x\\). if \\(p_x\u0026lt;p_y\\), the slope of the budget constraint is steeper than the slope of the indifference \u0026ldquo;curves.\u0026rdquo; The optimal bundle is spending all income on good \\(y\\). if \\(p_x=p_y\\), the budget constraint and indifference \u0026ldquo;curves\u0026rdquo; are the same line, so any point on the lines is optimal!

So the income expansion path (see previous class) is a straight line through the origin with a slope \\(\\frac{a}{p_x}\\).\nEXAMPLE Suppose a consumer has a utility function\n$$u(x,y)=x^{0.5}y^{0.5}$$\nand faces constraints of \\(m=50\\), \\(p_a=10\\), \\(p_b=5\\).\n$$\\max_{x,y} x^{0.5}y^{0.5}$$ $$\\text{subject to } 10x+5y=50$$\nWrite the Lagrangian (and taking logs of the objective function, for simplicity):\n$$\\mathbb{L} = 0.5 \\: ln \\: x+0.5 \\: ln \\: y-\\lambda(10x+5y-50)$$\nFOCs are:\n$$\\begin{align*} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbb{L}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{0.5}{x}-10\\lambda \u0026amp;= 0 \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbb{L}}{\\partial y} = \\frac{0.5}{y}-5\\lambda \u0026amp;= 0 \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbb{L}}{\\partial \\lambda} = 10x+5y-50 \u0026amp;= 0\\\\ \\end{align*}$$\nRearrange the first two FOCs:\n$$\\begin{align*} 0.5\u0026amp;=10 \\lambda x\\\\ 0.5\u0026amp;=5 \\lambda y\\\\ \\end{align*}$$\nAdd then together, and solve for \\(\\lambda\\):\n$$\\begin{align*} 1\u0026amp;=\\lambda(10x+5y)\\\\ 1\u0026amp;=\\lambda(50)\\\\ \\frac{1}{50}\u0026amp;=\\lambda\\\\ \\end{align*}$$\nNow substitute lambda into each of the first two FOCs, solving for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), respectively:\n$$\\begin{align*} \\frac{0.5}{x}\u0026amp;=10(\\frac{1}{50})\\\\ 10x\u0026amp;=0.5(50)\\\\ x\u0026amp;=2.5\\\\ \\end{align*}$$\n$$\\begin{align*} \\frac{0.5}{y}\u0026amp;=5(\\frac{1}{50})\\\\ 10x\u0026amp;=0.5(50)\\\\ y\u0026amp;=5\\\\ \\end{align*}$$\nThis consumer buys 2.5 units of \\(x\\) at $10/each ($25) and 5 units of \\(y\\) at $5/each ($25), spending all $50.\nRecall the utility function is\n$$u(x, y)=\\sqrt{xy}=x^{0.5}y^{0.5}$$\nNote the Cobb-Douglas exponents on \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are equal and sum to 1: \\((a\\) and \\(1-a=0.5)\\). So the consumer spends \\(a=50\\%\\) of her income on \\(x\\), and \\(1-a=50\\%\\) on \\(y\\).\nTo get the demand functions for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), go back to the FOCs, and keep all budget constraint terms as variables \\((p_x, p_y, m)\\).\n$$\\begin{align*} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbb{L}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{0.5}{x}-p_x\\lambda \u0026amp;= 0 \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbb{L}}{\\partial y} = \\frac{0.5}{y}-p_y\\lambda \u0026amp;= 0 \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbb{L}}{\\partial \\lambda} = p_xx+p_yy-m \u0026amp;= 0\\\\ \\end{align*}$$\nRearrange the first two FOCs:\n$$\\begin{align*} 0.5\u0026amp;=p_x \\lambda a\\\\ 0.5\u0026amp;=p_y \\lambda y\\\\ \\end{align*}$$\nAdd then together, and solve for \\(\\lambda\\):\n$$\\begin{align*} 1\u0026amp;=\\lambda(p_xx+p_yy)\\\\ 1\u0026amp;=\\lambda(m)\\\\ \\frac{1}{m}\u0026amp;=\\lambda\\\\ \\end{align*}$$\nSubstitute this back into each of the first two FOCs and solve for \\(x\\), and \\(y\\), respectively, to get:\n$$\\begin{align*} \\frac{0.5}{x}-p_x\\lambda\u0026amp;=0\\\\ \\frac{0.5}{x}-p_x \\left(\\frac{1}{m}\\right)\u0026amp;=0\\\\ \\frac{0.5}{x}\u0026amp;=\\frac{p_x}{m}\\\\ p_xx\u0026amp;=0.5m\\\\ x\u0026amp;=0.5\\frac{m}{p_x}\\\\ \\end{align*}$$\n$$\\begin{align*} \\frac{0.5}{y}-p_y\\lambda\u0026amp;=0\\\\ \\frac{0.5}{y}-p_y \\left(\\frac{1}{m}\\right)\u0026amp;=0\\\\ \\frac{0.5}{y}\u0026amp;=\\frac{p_y}{m}\\\\ p_yy\u0026amp;=0.5m\\\\ y\u0026amp;=0.5\\frac{m}{p_y}\\\\ \\end{align*}$$\nThese are the demand functions for \\(x\\) and for \\(y\\).^[Note you can just take the rule learned above, that \\(x=a\\frac{m}{p_x}\\) and \\(y=b\\frac{m}{p_y}\\) and plug in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).]\nNote if we want to graph this, we need to find the inverse demand function by solving for \\(p_x\\):\n$$\\begin{align*} x\u0026amp;=0.5\\frac{m}{p_x} \\\\ p_xx\u0026amp;=0.5m\\\\ p_x\u0026amp;=0.5\\frac{m}{x} \\\\ \\end{align*}$$\nNow we can graph a demand function for a given amount of income.

We also (re-)introduce the idea of price elasticity of demand that measures a person’s responsiveness in consumption to a change in that good’s price. However, unlike what you learned in principles2 we look at the elasticity of any point on the demand curve using a more useful formula: \\[\\epsilon_{q,p}=\\frac{1}{slope} \\times \\frac{p}{q}\\] where slope refers to the slope of the inverse demand curve (the one that we graph).\nWe will look at the key relationship between price elasticity of demand and total revenue,3 and work on some practice problems.\nTo allow you to work on Exam 1 (see below), there will be no class on Monday Mar 1 (for section 1 M/W) or Thursday Mar 4 (for section 2 Tu/Th).\n  Readings   Ch. 2.2, 2.5, 5.5, in Goolsbee, Levitt, and Syverson, 2019    Slides \n  Download as PDF    Practice Today we will be working on practice problems. Answers will be posted later on that page.\n Example Applications of Consumer Theory Models Uncertainty: We have examined cases where outcomes are certain. What if outcomes are not guaranteed, but are uncertain (i.e. probabilistic)? Things like your health, your investments, and the integrity of your property (from theft, natural disasters, war, etc) certainly fall into this category. For this reason, we take out insurance on valuable things that have some probability of significantly losing their value. Let’s explore how Consumer Theory can make our actions more intelligible. Exchange: We have examined the case of a single individual (a consumer) making optimal choices given market prices, income, and their preferences. In one sense, an economy is just a collection of millions of these individuals all doing the same thing. But economics truly begins where at the more important stage where these individuals interact and exchange with one another. In particular, we want to examine how relative prices and income are determined in an economy (up until now we simply assumed them as given parameters). They must come from somewhere! – the interactions of individuals buying and selling with one another, responding in order to balance supply and demand. This is where the study of (general) equilibrium comes from, and what the traditional Supply and Demand model captures in its simplifications. Taxation: This handout uses consumer theory to answer a simple question: which is better for consumers, a consumption tax (tax per unit), or an equivalent income tax that raises the same amount of revenue for the government? Intertemporal Choice (TBD): All of our models thus far have only looked at present consumption and ignored any element of time. We can also look at intertemporal choice, that is, consumption decisions over time. This often touches on topics that most consider “macroeconomics,” concepts like interest rates, borrowing, lending, etc. However, these “big picture” ideas must come from actual individual decisions to consume or to save, aggregated across many individuals. Even macroeconomic theories often require “micro-foundations.” Abstract and complex concepts like interest are actually just applications of relative price theory–interest itself is a relative price of consumption today vs. consumption in the future!

M. Forster\n  “No economist has achieved scientific success as a result of a statistically significant coefficient. Massed observations, clever common sense, elegant theorems, new policies, sagacious economic reasoning, historical perspective, relevant accounting, these have all led to scientific success.

The purpose of this paper is threefold: (1) to demonstrate to me that you have mastered the material of this course, (2) to develop your writing, communication, and data analysis skills, and (3) to help you develop, strengthen, and/or modify your own views by grappling with them in writing. As a reminder, this paper constitutes 25% of your final course grade.\nI will spend a significant portion of one class discussing more about the writing process, and provide a detailed guide to help you choose a topic, craft arguments, and write a good paper.\nI am NOT looking for a survey of existing research, a series of block quotes showing what some economist said about X, a regurgitation of my lectures, a list of pros and cons with a last minute conclusion, a book review, and so on. I also do NOT want you to compress everything about econometrics you learned from this class into a single paper. You should only use those insights that are relevant to your topic and your argument (it may only be one or two things!).\nI am looking for a paper that attempts to answer a specific research question of interest to economists by using data analysis. You should be able to summarize your paper in one or two sentences – the specific research question your paper addresses, your method for answering it, and your results. It should be a reasonably original paper (it is difficult with limited knowledge, time, and data to offer something truly original), and it should be your own take on the topic. I expect you to, at the very least, have one multivariate regression used to reach your conclusions. I do not expect or require you to find statistically significant results.\nPlease note that, while you are not required to, I highly recommend discussing your ideas with me over email or in person. I will also read any drafts you would like to submit to me early, and provide you with helpful comments, subject to my own availability. I will stop accepting drafts to provide comments by November 30.\n Length, References, \u0026amp; Mechanics I hesitate to give formal length requirements, because most students will write the bare minimum, and also because different papers have different optimal lengths. What truly matters is that your paper is long enough to say what you need to say, to say it well, and to say it briefly. Ceterus paribus, if papers \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) say the same thing, but paper \\(B\\) says it in half the length (without sacrificing key arguments), paper \\(B\\) is a better paper. You will also find that simply by including the necessary components of an empirical paper (plots, tables, etc.), your page count will by necessity increase on its own.\nSince you of course still want to know what a good length will be, my rule of thumb is that your paper should be about \\(\\mathbf{10\\pm 5}\\) pages (size 12 font, double spaced, 1\" margins). This will depend on the topic you have chosen to written on, your data, and your own personal writing style.\nI would also like you to use scholarly references, that is, articles from economics journals and cite them properly. I do not have a minimum requirement of the amount of references, but I expect you to have at least 2-5 scholarly references, depending on your paper topic and thesis. I am not particularly picky about exactly how you format your citations or bibliography, just please be consistent, and do not use footnotes or endnotes (only because they annoy me). I suggest the APA author-year-page in-text citation format that is fairly standard in economics journals, i.e.: “The division of labor is limited by the extent of the market,” (Smith 1776: 27). Look at my slides or my handouts for a suggested bibliography style. If you use .bib files, the default formatting is fine.\n Sources for Inspiration Here is a list of a few places you might consider to dig up some information on your topic, or to help you find a topic. Just be sure to read and cite the actual sources that these secondary sources cite.\n Major news outlets (e.g. CNN, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, USA Today, Huffington Post, the Guardian) and wherever you may find your news (e.g. reddit, Buzzfeed, etc) both for current events, and also their Opinion/Commentary sections for other op-eds to learn from and/or critique Wikipedia – no seriously, it is the first place I go to learn about a new topic. Just be sure to actually investigate the underlying research and use that for your references! Economics Podcasts  Econtalk – a fantastic podcast series by Russ Roberts that interviews famous economists, philosophers, businesspeople, and other figures who have an impact on the world of ideas Freakonomics (Radio) – another great podcast by one of the authors of the famed Freakonomics books about intermediate-level economic topics, often an in-depth series of interviews on a major issue NPR Planet Money – another good podcast series on economics topics and current events, much shorter and more 10,000-foot level approach than Econtalk or Freakonomics  Popular Economists’ Blogs/Blogs on Economics:  Marginal Revolution – Tyler Cowen \u0026amp; Alex Tabarrok (head and shoulders above the rest!) Cafe Hayek – Don Boudreaux (libertarian-leaning, mostly just Don on trade and micro-policy) EconLog – Bryan Caplan, David Henderson (libertarian-leaning, good analysis) The Conscience of a Liberal – Paul Krugman at New York Times (strong left-wing politics) The Grumpy Economist – John Cochrane (Chicago School approach) Greg Mankiw’s Blog – Greg Mankiw (moderate conservative, New Keynesian approach) Undercover Economist – Tim Harford (British, non-political, very easy to understand) Chris Blattman – Chris Blattman (great on economic development, poverty, and conflict in poor countries) Slate Star Codex – “Scott Alexander” (a pseudonym, apparently a Medical Student, but one of the most lucid social science blogs ever written) Fivethirtyeight – Nate Silver \u0026amp; co. (a journalist, but a leader on using data and statistics in social science and journalism) Andrew Gelman – Andrew Gelman (a statistician, but another leader on using data and statistics for social science)    Data Sources While it is one thing to find a topic to write on, it is an altogether different animal to find data to use to test empirical research questions. You will find out quickly that the constraint to writing an empirical paper is not the set of topics or questions to write on (though that is often a challenge itself!), but the data available to use.\nDepending on the topic, you can also collect your own data, and many times you will want to create a custom dataset by simply combining data from different sources.\nDon’t forget to check out the Data Resources for ideas and examples of how and where to find data sets.\n Grading Rubric and Deadlines While it may be possible for many papers in your college career, is not a paper you can write the last minute and do well on. To ensure that you do not get too far behind, I have split the assignment into stages that are due at different intervals over the semester. Note that your topic can and may change depending on what you are able to find and work with. The hardest part is finding data that allows you to test a research question. It is primarily for this reason that writing an empirical paper on what you want is very difficult.\n    Assignment Points Due Date Description    Abstract 5 Sun Oct 11 Short summary of your ideas  Literature Review 10 Sun Nov 1 1-3 paragraphs on 2-3 scholarly sources  Data Description 10 Sun Nov 15 Description of data sources, and some summary statistics  Presentation 5 Thurs Nov 19 Short presentation of your project so far  Final Paper Due 70 Tues Nov 22 Email to me paper, data, and code    All assignments are due by emails to me.\n Abstract: write a short paragraph (3-6 sentences) summarizing: what rough topic you want to look at, a specific research question that you think you can get data to test, where you think you might be able to get some data. It’s okay that much of this is speculative and you might change your mind or do very different things later!\n Data Description: describe what data you managed to find (a few paragraphs): where is/are the dataset(s) from? What variables are included, and how are they measured (e.g. what units, categories, etc)? Give us some summary statistics of the data (a table would be nice, some scatterplots and histograms would be nice), are there any interesting patterns?\n Literature Review: find 2-3 scholarly sources (ideally scholarly journal articles) that discuss your research question (or related topics), especially if they have empirical findings. Explain what these sources found, how they found it, and how your paper relates to this literature. Don’t worry about being original!\n Presentation: a 5-10 minute presentation of what you have so far. Different people will be at different stages, since your paper is not due yet! Use this as an opportunity to get feedback from me and your classmates, that might help you finish your project. Using some slides to show tables, models, and plots is highly recommended.  Example](/papers/Presentation_example.pdf) --\n Final Paper Due: email the full paper to me (see below for what should be in the email).\n  The remaining 70% for the final product are broken down as follows:\n  Category Points    Persuasiveness 10  Clarity 10  Econometric Validity 20  Economic Soundness 20  Organization 5  References 5  TOTAL 70     Persuasiveness: How persuasive is your argument? Would a reasonably educated college-level reader who is familiar with economics and statistics but not necessarily this course find themselves understanding your argument and agreeing with you? [Write for an audience wider than just members of this class. Therefore, don’t use terms, sources, or “inside jokes” that only other students in this class (and no one else) would understand.] Remember, your goal is not to convince me (though you may), your goal is to convince any educated reader, and I grade you the probability that this is likely. You are the lawyer, I am the judge, and your audience is the jury. Clarity How clear is your paper? Is it clear what your research question is, how you answer it, and what your results are? Can you summarize these in a sentence or two? Are there confusing passages, excessive jargon or passive voice, or irrelevant arguments and examples? Econometric Validity: Is your econometric model sensible and plausible? Do you adequately address the assumptions and limitations of your model? Do you use appropriate data? Do you adequately describe your data, identify patterns, aberrations, and clearly generate testable hypotheses from your data? Would someone else, given your data, be able to replicate your findings? Economic Soundness: Do you place your empirical question in a broader context of applying economic principles? Do you describe relevant economic policies, institutions, relationships, and/or other relevant economic principles to the questions you are asking? Are your theories and hypotheses about relationships between data plausible and intuitive? Do you makes sense of your hypotheses and the results of your analysis and connect them to sound economic principles? Is your question, strategy, and/or results of interest to economists? You will lose up to 20 points for papers that have no economic content. Organization: Is your paper organized? Have you presented your separate arguments/examples in a logical order? Is it clear when you are moving on from one section to another? Is it clear when and where you are summarizing and concluding? Is your paper presented according to professional norms (e.g. summary statistics tables, regression tables, etc)? References: Does your paper use multiple scholarly references? Does it properly cite them in the text for main ideas borrowed and for direct quotations (if applicable)? Are they consistently listed at the end in a references section? Style: Is your paper interesting and easy to read? Does it engage the reader? Is it written in active voice? This is somewhat subjective, and hence, the smallest portion of your grade.   Emailing Your Final Version to Me When you send your final email (by Tuesday November 22), it should contain the following files:\nYour final paper as a .pdf. It should include an abstract and bibliography and all tables and figures contained within it. The (commented!) code used for your data analysis (i.e. loading data, making tables, making plots, running regressions). These can be either .R files: one or multiple (one-per-task) are equally fine OR a .Rmd file. I want to know how you reached the results you got! Reproducibility is the goal! Your data used, in whatever original format you found it (e.g. .csv, .xlsx, .dta)  Again, you are not obligated to use R Markdown to write your paper.

Hayek (1974 Economics Nobel Laureate)\n Game theory is a collection of analytical tools used to rigorously study strategic interactions between rational agents. It is one of the most useful and powerful theoretical innovations in 20th century social science, and has been applied extensively in economics, political science, psychology, sociology, logic, computer science, animal behavior, and evolutionary biology. At least twelve economists have won the Nobel Prize for research directly related to game theory (and arguably more have made tangential contributions). This is an economics course, so the majority of our focus and applications will be in economic settings, though we will examine a much wider scope of strategic interactions than the “narrow” economic domain of firms and consumers.\nPlease don’t get the wrong idea — this course is not the theory of “games” in the colloquial sense (e.g. chess, poker, football, Fortnite, etc)! This course is not designed to make a you a better [insert favorite game] player (but that may be a side effect!). A “game” in social science is defined according to certain technical criteria. Furthermore, formal game theory is highly abstract and very mathematical. I will try to balance formal theory with interesting real world applications, sometimes including colloquial “games.”\nGame theory is a direct extension of basic microeconomics, so this class assumes you have met the required prerequisite course(s) — ECON 206. My approach to game theory requires some math, but it will not be exclusively about the math.\nCourse Format and Covid As of Fall 2021, all students are expected to be on campus except those with special approved exemptions. As such, this course will be taught in-person and synchronously until or unless otherwise announced.\n Course objectives By the end of this course, you will:\n Recognize different types of strategic interactions across different domains of life (e.g. economics, political science, biology, etc.) Recognize common types of games, e.g. prisoners’ dilemma, stag hunt, battle of the sexes, chicken, hawk-dove Solve for equilibria of games in normal form, extended form, in pure \u0026amp; mixed strategies, Understand the role of information, sequencing, credible commitments, repetition, etc. Become familiar with some of the economics (and other) literatures that use game theoretic tools  Given these objectives, this course fulfills all three of the learning outcomes for the George B. Delaplaine, Jr. School of Business Economics B.A. program:\n Use quantitative tools and techniques in the preparation, interpretation, analysis and presentation of data and information for problem solving and decision making […] Apply economic reasoning and models to understand and analyze problems of public policy […] Demonstrate effective oral and written communications skills for personal and professional success[…]  Fair warning: Economics is hard. This, in particular, may be of the hardest courses that you will take, primarily due to the mathematical content. Using the economic way of thinking is a skill, it is literally retraining your brain to interpret and analyze the world in a novel way, and is not something that can be memorized. I will do my best to make this class intuitive and helpful, if not interesting. If at any point you find yourself struggling in this course for any reason, please come see me. Do not suffer in silence! Coming to see me for help does not diminish my view of you, in fact I will hold you in higher regard for understanding your own needs and taking charge of your own learning. There are also a some fantastic resources on campus, such as the Center for Academic Achievement and Retention (CAAR) and the Beneficial-Hodson Library.\nSee my tips for success in this course.\n Required Course materials You can find all course materials at my dedicated website for this course: gameF21.classes.ryansafner.com. Links to the website are posted on our Blackboard course page. Please familiarize yourself with the website, see that it contains this syllabus, guides for your reference, and our schedule. On the schedule page, you can find each module with its own class page (start there!) along with all related readings, lecture slides, practice problems, and assignments.\nMy lecture slides will be shared with you, and serve as your primary resource, but our main “textbook” below is recommended as the next best resource and will be available from the campus bookstore. I will discuss more about textbooks and materials in the first module.\nBooks My lecture slides (made available to you) are the primary resource for the material and the best guide to prepare for homeworks and exams. There are two books that we will roughly be following in parallel, both available at the bookstore (or you can find them on Amazon, ebay, etc). You may choose to purchase used or old versions, but be aware that content and ordering may slightly vary across versions.\nDixit, Avinash K and Barry J Nalebuff, 2008, The Art of Strategy: A Game Theorist’s Guide to Success in Business and Life, New York: W.W. Norton and Company Dixit, Avinash K, Susan Skeath, and David H Reily Jr, 2014, Games of Strategy, 4th ed, New York: W.W. Norton and Company Purchase a Moblab account ($10) at moblab.com  The first book is a popular, read-on-the-beach style paperback that covers the topics in a readable way. It is listed as required in the bookstore, and should be fairly cheap on Amazon. It mirrors the topics in the next book in roughly the same order but certainly at a more general (and less mathematical) manner.\nThe second book is the more common textbook-style As with any textbook, this will be more expensive but a deeper dive into the material that may help with your understanding. It is listed as recommended in the bookstore.\nIf you purchase the second book, it is superfluous for you to purchase the first book, unless you really would like to!\nFinally, purchase an account on moblab.com so that we can all play games in class together on common software.\nI leave it to you to determine your own optimal strategy in purchasing (or not) any textbooks. There is no dominant strategy here.\n  Assignments and Grades Your final course grade is the weighted average of the following assignments. You can find general descriptions for all the assignments on the assignments page and more specific information and examples on each assignment’s page on the schedule page.\n   Frequency  Assignment  Weight      n  Homeworks  25% (using average HW grade)    1  Paper  20%    1  Midterm Exam  20%    3  Final Exam  20% (each)     Each assignment is graded on a 100 point scale. Letter-grade equivalents are based on the following scale:\n  Grade  Range  Grade  Range      A  93–100%  C  73–76%    A−  90–92%  C−  70–72%    B+  87–89%  D+  67–69%    B  83–86%  D  63–66%    B−  80–82%  D−  60–62%    C+  77–79%  F  \u0026lt; 60%     See also my  Grade Calculator app where you can calculate your overall grade using existing assignment grades and forecast “what if” scenarios.\nThese grades are firm cutoffs, but I do of course round upwards \\((\\geq\\) 0.5) for final grades. A necessary reminder, as an academic, I am not in the business of giving out grades, I merely report the grade that you earn. I will not alter your grade unless you provide a reasonable argument that I am in error (which does happen from time to time).\nHomeworks There will be roughly a homework assignment every few lessons. These questions will help check your understanding and mastery of the material, and will be a combination of quantitative, graph, and short answer questions of examples. These will also be good indicators of what to expect on the exams. You may collaborate with other students to work on homeworks (and I encourage that!), but each person must turn in an individual assignment.\nHomeworks are generally due by 11:59 PM EST Sunday by submission to Blackboard Assignments.\nPlease type your answers to the following questions in a document and save as a PDF2 to upload on Blackboard under Assignments. You may handwrite answers if you will be able to scan/photograph \u0026amp; convert them to a single PDF, if they are easily readable, but this is not preferred. See my guide to making a PDF - an essential skill in the modern world. If you are handwriting answers, you may print the pdf above and write on it, or just write on a piece of paper (we only need your answers).\nFor the few questions that ask you to draw a graph, try to do so on your computer (use MS Paint, the drawing tools in MS Word or MS Powerpoint, plot points in MS Excel, drawing/notetaking apps, etc.), and save it as an image to include on your homework document. Again, they need not be perfect or to scale, just show that you understand the broad idea. Being able to understand and sketch the graphs is still a very important and useful skill! If all else fails, I will be lenient in grading graph questions if you are unable to technologically include a graph.\nYour TA, under my supervision, will grade homeworks 70% for completion, and for the remaining 30%, and one question will be graded for accuracy - so it is best that you try every problem, even if you are unsure how to complete it accurately.\n Exams There will be three exams (one at the end of each unit) including the final exam. Each exam only covers the material in its associated unit (i.e. no exam is cumulative). These exams provide feedback both to you and to me that ensures everyone is progressing on schedule and apprehending the material. This is critical, as the rest of the course, and indeed, any future economics course you take, will build off of this foundation.\nExams will be released on Blackboard as a timed assignment. You will have 2 hours once you open the exam on Blackboard. You will not need the whole time, I have given you some extra to accommodate the difficulties of taking an exam at home. Please pick a time to take it where you know you will have 2 hours. You may close the exam page and come back to it, but the timer will continue to run once the exam is first opened.\n Opinion-Editorial Economic fallacies have always been popular, and journalists, politicians, and talking heads consistently engage in faulty economic reasoning in print and on television. Your task, as a student of economics, is to find some issue discussed in the past year, and write a critique of media discussion of that issue. Alternatively, instead of critiquing the reasoning or statements of others, you may write an advocacy piece, where you propose some economic policy and argue to persuade readers to endorse it. You will be graded both on the soundness of your economic reasoning and the quality of your writing. I would be happy to co-author an Op-Ed with anyone who writes an exemplary Op-Ed. Students who successfully publish their work in a media outlet will earn extra credit on their Op-Ed grade. I will provide ample resources and examples to help you accomplish this, you can find more on the associated assignment page.\n No extra credit is available   Policies and Expectations This syllabus is a contract between you, the student, and me, your instructor. It has been carefully and deliberately thought out3, and I will uphold my end of the agreement and expect you to uphold yours.\nIn the language of game theory, this syllabus is my commitment device. I am a very understanding person, and I know that exceptions to rules often need to be made for students. However, to be fair to all students the syllabus artificially constrains my ability to make exceptions at a whim for anyone. This prevents clever students from exploiting my congenial personality at everyone else’s expense. Please read and familiarize yourself with the course policies and expectations of you. Chances are, if you have a question, it is answered herein.\nThis is a hybrid course with synchronous (live) and asynchronous (on your own time) parts.\nYou are generally expected to join (online via Zoom) our synchronous class sessions unless circumstances prevent you from doing so. Day-to-day attendance is not graded per se, but I strongly recommend you join in all live sessions in which you are able, since we all can provide live feedback and I can answer questions and address concerns as soon as they come up. You will also benefit from a rigid schedule and shared community.\nIf you are unable to make a particular class, you generally do not need to let me know. The videos from all class sessions are posted on Blackboard so please review videos of classes you were unable to attend live.\nAll assignmnents are able to be completed asynchronously during the week, and are generally due by 11:59PM Sunday each week to allow you flexibility in your hectic schedules.\nLate Assignments I will accept late assignments, but will subtract a specified amount of points as a penalty. Even if it is the last week of the semester, I encourage you to turn in late work: some points are better than no points!\nHomeworks: If you turn in a homework after it is due but before it is graded or the answer key posted, I generally will not take off any points. However, if you turn in a homework after the answer key is posted, I will automatically deduct 20 points (so the maximum grade you can earn on it is an 80).\nExams: If you know that you will be unable to complete an exam as scheduled for a legitimate reason, please notify me at least one week in advance, and we will schedule a make-up exam date. Failure to do so, including desperate attempts to make arrangements only after the exam will result in a grade of 0 and little sympathy. I reserve the right to re-weight other assignments for students who I believe are legitimately unable to complete a particular assignment.\nOp-eds: Starting at the deadline, I will take off 1 point for every hour that your Op-ed is late.\n Grading I will try my best to post grades on Blackboard’s Grading Center and return graded assignments to you within about one week of you turning them in. There will be exceptions. Where applicable, I will post answer keys once I know most homeworks are turned in (see Late Assignments above for penalties). Blackboard’s Grading Center is the place to look for your most up-to-date grades. See also my  Grade Calculator app where you can calculate your overall grade using existing assignment grades and forecast “what if” scenarios.\n Communication: Email, Slack, and Virtual Office Hours Students must regularly monitor their Hood email accounts to receive important college information, including messages related to this class. Email through the Blackboard system is my main method of communicating announcements and deadlines regarding your assignments. Please do not reply to any automated Blackboard emails - I may not recieve it!. My Hood email (safner@hood.edu) is the best means of contacting me. I will do my best to respond within 24 hours. If I do not reply within 48 hours, do not take it personally, and feel free to send a follow up email in the very likely event that I genuinely did not see your original message.\nOur slack channel is available to all students and faculty in Economics and Business. I have invited all of my classes and advisees. It will not be extended to non-Business/Economics students or faculty. All users must use their hood emails and true first and last names. Each course has its own channel, exclusive for verified students in the course, and myself, by my invite only. As a third party platform, you agree to its Terms of Service. I have created this space as a way to stay connected, to help one another, and to foster community. Behaviors such as posting inappropriate content, harassing others, or engaging in academic dishonesty, to be determined solely at my discretion, will result in one warning, the content will be deleted, and subsequent behavior will result in a ban.\nI will host general “office hours” on Zoom. You can join in with video, audio, and/or chat, whichever you feel comfortable with. Of course, if you are not available during those times, we can schedule our own time if you prefer this method over email or Slack. If you want to go over material from class, please have specific questions you want help with. I am not in the business of giving private lectures (particularly if you missed class without a valid excuse).\nWatch this excellent and accurate video explaining office hours:\n  Netiquette When using Zoom and Slack, please follow appropriate internet etiquette (“Netiquette”). Written communications, like blog posts or use of the Zoom chat, lacks important nonverbal cues (such as body language, tone of voice, sarcasm, etc).\nAbove all else, please respect one another and think/reread carefully about how others may see your post before you submit a comment. You are expected to disagree and have different opinions, this is inherently valuable in a discussion. Please be civil and constructive in responding to others’ comments: writing “have you considered ‘X?’” is a lot more helpful to all involved than just writing “well you’re just wrong.”\nPosting content that is wilfully incindiary, illegal, or that constitutes academic dishonesty (such as plagarism) will automatically earn a grade of 0 and may be elevated to other authorities on campus.\nWhen using the chat function on Zoom or public Slack channels, please treat it as official course communications, even though I may not be grading it. It may be a quick and informal tool - don’t feel you need to worry about spelling or perfect grammar - but please try to avoid too informal “text-speak” (i.e. say “That’s good for you” instead of “thas good 4 u”).\n Privacy Maryland law requires all parties consent for a conversation or meeting to be recorded. If you join in, and certainly if you participate, you are consenting to be recorded. However, as described below, videos are not accessible beyond our class.\nLive lectures are recorded on Zoom and posted to Blackboard via Panopto, a secure course management system for video. Among other nice features (such as multiple video screens, close captioning, and time-stamped search functions!), Panopto is authenticated via your Blackboard credentials, ensuring that our course videos are not accessible to the open internet.\nFor the privacy of your peers, and to foster an environment of trust and academic freedom to explore ideas, do not record our course lectures or discussions. You are already getting my official copies.\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act prevents me from disclosing or discussing any student information, including grades and records about student performance. If the student is at least 18 years of age, parents (or spouses) do not have a right to obtain this information, except with consent by the student.\nMany of you may be tuning in remotely, living with parents, and may have occasional interruptions due to sharing a space. This is normal and fine, but know that I will protect your privacy and not discuss your performance when parents (or anyone other than you, for that matter) are present, without your explicit consent.\n Enrollment Students are responsible for verifying their enrollment in this class. The last day to add or drop this class with no penalty is Wednesday, February 10. Be aware of important dates.\n Honor Code Hood College has an Academic Honor Code which requires all members of this community to maintain the highest standards of academic honesty and integrity. Cheating, plagiarism, lying, and stealing are all prohibited. All violations of the Honor Code are taken seriously, will be reported to appropriate authority, and may result in severe penalties, including expulsion from the college. See here for more detailed information.\n Van Halen and M\u0026amp;Ms When you have completed reading the syllabus, email me a picture of the band Van Halen and a picture of a bowl of M\u0026amp;Ms. If you do this before the date of the first exam, you will get bonus points on the exam.4 Yes, this is real.\n Accessibility, Equity, and Accommodations College courses can, and should, be challenging and bring you out of your comfort zone in a safe and equitable environment. If, however, you feel at any point in the semester that certain assignments or aspects of the course will be disproportionately uncomfortable or burdensome for you due to any factor beyond your control, please come see me or email me. I am a very understanding person and am happy to work out a solution together. I reserve the right to modify and reweight assignments at my sole discretion for students that I belive would legitimately be at a disadvantage, through no fault of their own, to complete them as described.\nIf you are unable to afford required textbooks or other resources for any reason, come see me and we can find a solution that works for you.\nThis course is intended to be accessible for all students, including those with mental, physical, or cognitive disabilities, illness, injuries, impairments, or any other condition that tends to negatively affect one’s equal access to education. If at any point in the term, you find yourself not able to fully access the space, content, and experience of this course, you are welcome to contact me to discuss your specific needs. I also encourage you to contact the Office of Accessibility Services (301-696-3421). If you have a diagnosis or history of accommodations in high school or previous postsecondary institutions, Accessibility Services can help you document your needs and create an accommodation plan. By making a plan through Accessibility Services, you can ensure appropriate accommodations without disclosing your condition or diagnosis to course instructors.\n ACBSP Information Hood College is an accredited member of the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP), an organization devoted to enhancing business education. In receiving and maintaining this accreditation, the faculty has made a commitment to the continuous improvement, innovation, and scholarship of the Department of Economics and Management. For you, this means that your educational experience undergoes ongoing validation to ensure it meets the most rigorous international standards of business education.
