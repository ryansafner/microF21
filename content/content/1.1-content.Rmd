## <i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-lg"></i> Overview

<span class="newthought">Welcome</span> to ECON 306 — Microeconomic Analysis! Today's lesson will be an overview of the content and the assignments of the course. Please read and familiarize yourself with the [syllabus](/syllabus). 

This is not just a “syllabus day,” as we need to hit the ground running, but today will give you a “big picture” look at this semester, and how to use microeconomic analysis, by focusing on the two main tools/models: **optimization** and **equilibrium**. We will dive right into optimization models next class.

## <i class="fas fa-book-reader fa-lg"></i> Readings

Today is introductory, but you may look at Chapter 1 if you wish, to remind you about the use of models in economics. Otherwise, please heed this timeless message:
